            "There are a lot of 13-inch and 14-inch laptops out there, but very few offer much in the way of user-upgradability.\n",
            "Framework, a San Francisco-based startup, sees an opening in the market there.\n",
            "The new 13.5-inch Framework laptop allows customers to upgrade and replace not only internal parts (RAM, battery, storage), but also external components (the keyboard, bezels, and ports).\n",
            "If you're very particular about your specs, you can also order a “DIY edition,” including parts of your choosing, and assemble the laptop yourself.\n",
            "I suspect most people will go for one of the three pre-built systems that Framework has on offer, which can then be tweaked as needed.\n",
            "Outside of its customizability, the Framework is a fairly standard productivity ultraportable.\n",
            "It's a bit smaller than an M1 MacBook Pro, at 2.87 pounds and 0.62 inches thick.\n",
            "The chassis incorporates recycled materials.\n",
            "There's a decently bright 3:2 display (with no touch option as of now), and a usable keyboard and touchpad.\n",
            "You'll get decent performance from Intel's 11th Gen processors, and okay (but unexciting) battery life.\n",
            "In other words, upgradability is the reason to buy the Framework laptop — there's not much else to discuss here.\n",
            "And while it looks like a good package from where I'm standing, much of its value proposition hinges on whether the company lives up to its promise of supporting the device for years to come.\n",
            "The pre-built systems should cover most use cases.\n",
            "The most unique benefit the Framework offers is the opportunity to customize ports.\n",
            "The chassis has four bays, but you can order as many expansion cards as you want, including USB-C, USB-A, microSD, HDMI, DP, and storage expansion (250GB or 1TB).\n",
            "Framework says more options are coming.\n",
            "I stuck in a USB-A, a USB-C, an HDMI, and some extra storage, and it was a very easy task.\n",
            "The cards are essentially dongles — they slide right in, and you can swap them while the computer's on.\n",
            "I was also able to swap out the black bezels on the model I was sent for some white ones.\n",
            "This took about 10 seconds.\n",
            "The top and side bezels attach to the chassis via magnets, and there are strips of adhesive along the bottom edge, so it's just a matter of pulling one frame off and sticking another on — you can do it while the laptop's running.\n",
            "(Framework claims that the adhesive is reusable, so you can swap bezels back and forth.)\n",
            "You can also replace the keyboard, touchpad, and fingerprint reader, both individually and as a sheet.\n",
            "Then, you can pop the keyboard off to tinker with the internal components — even the mainboard.\n",
            "This is easy enough to do, but one annoyance is that the chassis is held together with T5 screws, which won't play nice with a standard Phillips screwdriver.\n",
            "(Framework says this is because the T5 avoids stripping issues that can come up with Phillips screws.)\n",
            "If you don't already have a kit with a T5 screwdriver, you'd better make sure you don't lose the tool that Framework sends with the laptop (and it's small — I'm sure I would lose it).\n",
            "In theory, all of these replacement parts will be available on a centralized marketplace that's also open to third-party manufacturers.\n",
            "Each of the various components has a QR code on it that, when scanned, will pull up a purchase page for the part's replacement.\n",
            "This marketplace isn't live yet, so I can't speak to what's actually going to be available there — Framework says it'll be up in August.\n",
            "That sort of underscores a theme of this review, which is that so much of this laptop's value hinges on what its promised ecosystem and support network will actually look like.\n",
            "There are a few guides on Framework's website — for setting up the pre-builts and the DIY kit, replacing the bezels, replacing the keyboard, and replacing the mainboard — but some processes that people will likely want are still missing as of this writing.\n",
            "There's no guide to replacing the memory, for example (you have to find that in the mainboard replacement guide).\n",
            "Framework says that's coming soon.\n",
            "I also haven't been able to find a list of supported parts, or a list of each screw and its size, which could make losing a screw a nightmare.\n",
            "Framework says the former list is coming soon, and that it will add screw specifications to its repair guides “as we go.”\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "To use the Framework Laptop, you have to agree to:\n",
            "The following agreements are optional:\n",
            "That's six mandatory agreements and 12 optional ones to use this product.\n",
            "The Framework's build quality is a bit below that of top contenders at this price point; you're paying a bit extra for the Framework's futureproofing promise.\n",
            "The whole thing has a plasticky feel — it's not cheap, but it feels closer to Acer Aspire than it is to Dell XPS.\n",
            "And there's some flimsiness.\n",
            "Specifically, there's a bit of flex in the keyboard and a whole bunch in the screen.\n",
            "(I was actually worried about snapping the latter and didn't torque it as much as I could have.)\n",
            "And while I was never worried that the magnetic bezels were going to fall off, they're not too hard to pull loose, and I could definitely see them snagging on things or accumulating debris underneath.\n",
            "I do like that recycled material is being used here, including 50 percent PCR aluminum in the enclosure, “an average of” 30 percent PCR plastics, and 80 percent PCR packaging.\n",
            "Another thing to call out is the 3:2 display.\n",
            "It's one of the few parts of this laptop that can't currently be upgraded; you're stuck with a 2256 x 1504 non-touch panel.\n",
            "It reached 391 nits of brightness in my testing, which is quite good, and generally delivered a sharp picture — and the 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot more vertical space than the 16:9 panels you'll find on many 13-inch notebooks.\n",
            "It is quite glossy, though, and kicks back a bit more glare than I'm used to seeing from panels in this price range.\n",
            "I'll run through the rest of the laptop; the takeaway again is that reparability is the Framework's only real calling card.\n",
            "The keyboard is nicely backlit, with almost no bleed, and comfortable with 1.5mm of travel.\n",
            "There's a 1080p webcam with a physical shutter — its picture is an improvement over traditional 720p laptop fare.\n",
            "But neither is so astonishingly good that I'd buy the Framework just to get it.\n",
            "Performance-wise, the base model was fine.\n",
            "The bottom sometimes got toasty under my load of around a dozen Chrome tabs and apps, but it was never uncomfortable to use on my lap.\n",
            "Fans were occasionally audible, but mostly silent.\n",
            "All three processor options come with Intel's Iris Xe integrated graphics — there's no GPU option.\n",
            "The integrated GPU isn't enough to run highly demanding games, but it should do a good job with League of Legends and such.\n",
            "I got some lightweight photo editing done with no problem, though it wasn't quite as snappy as I've seen on Core i7 machines.\n",
            "Battery life was similarly acceptable but unremarkable.\n",
            "I averaged around six hours and 12 minutes of continuous work use with the screen at 200 nits of brightness.\n",
            "First and foremost: it's admirable what Framework is trying to do.\n",
            "This is a laptop that DIY computing enthusiasts have been waiting for.\n",
            "And there's certainly a lot here that's promising.\n",
            "The ports and bezels are easy to swap, even if you've never upgraded a computer before — and that's a legitimately unique feature.\n",
            "Plus, the fact that RAM isn't soldered, in a chassis of this size, is an upgradability victory in itself.\n",
            "But this community has been burned before.\n",
            "From Intel's Ghost Canyon NUC to Alienware's Area-51m, the virtual graveyard is littered with promised modular computers that never panned out because the company stopped making hardware for them.\n",
            "Dell was recently sued for allegedly promising that the Area-51m R1 could be upgraded to future Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, which did not end up being the case.\n",
            "This kind of device is hard to make and even harder to support over time.\n",
            "I asked Framework how many generations of Intel CPUs it was committed to supporting, and the company didn't give a direct answer.\n",
            "A spokesperson stated, “We've been evaluating upcoming silicon roadmaps, and don't see anything that makes us concerned about compatibility with our current chassis.\n",
            "We will continue to support the existing chassis for the forseeable future.”\n",
            "Sure.\n",
            "But until I actually have an Alder Lake mainboard in my hands, I'm hesitant to get too excited.\n",
            "Whether the Framework is a good purchase will depend on whether the company is actually able to forge ahead with this chassis — how long it continues releasing new modules, and whether it's able to build a robust library of supporting materials.\n",
            "It'll also depend on how good the promised marketplace is, and how robust the component selections are.\n",
            "Those are the real benefits of this device.\n",
            "Without them, the Framework is mostly an unremarkable laptop with lots of QR codes.\n",

            "Consumers won't be able to purchase this from a store, and it's really for businesses and schools looking to upgrade older machines.\n",
            "While I've bemoaned the current design of the Surface Pro for a couple of years now, there are some changes inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus that will appeal to many.\n",
            "Microsoft now offers built-in LTE on select models, and the SSD is now removable, much like the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X. Intel's latest processors also promise better performance and battery life.\n",
            "It's nearly everything you'd want from a Surface tablet in 2021, but I still wish it looked like a Surface Pro X with an Intel chip inside.\n",
            "Thankfully, the base model is now the Intel Core i3 version, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.\n",
            "Microsoft has dropped the 4GB of RAM option for the Plus model.\n",
            "Microsoft offers all 11 models in the classic silver option, but oddly the black version isn't available with built-in LTE.\n",
            "Overall, the hardware on the Surface Pro 7 Plus is almost identical to the Surface Pro 7.\n",
            "There's the same 12.3-inch (2736 x 1824) touchscreen with its 3:2 aspect ratio, a single USB-C port, and the regular USB-A port.\n",
            "Microsoft still hasn't made the switch to Thunderbolt 3 or 4 here, so you can't hook this tablet up to an external GPU or use many of the Thunderbolt drives and docks available.\n",
            "The real changes to the Surface Pro 7 Plus can be found inside.\n",
            "Microsoft has moved to Intel's latest 11th Gen processors, and you can pick between Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 variants.\n",
            "I've been testing the Core i5 model, and it has remained cool even when using heavy apps like video or video-editing software.\n",
            "Like other Core i5 Pro 7 models, this has no internal fan, so it's also silent while working.\n",
            "These latest processors also include Intel's Iris Xe graphics.\n",
            "While it's not enough to turn this into a portable gaming laptop, it does help make the Surface Pro 7 Plus feel a lot snappier in a variety of tasks.\n",
            "Combined with improved SSD read and write speeds, lightweight photo and video editing is certainly faster than what I'm used to with the regular Surface Pro 7.\n",
            "The biggest new hardware addition is built-in LTE, though.\n",
            "It's the first time the Surface Pro lineup has included this for a few years, but unfortunately there's no 5G support.\n",
            "Microsoft is using Qualcomm's older Snapdragon X20 LTE modem inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus.\n",
            "There's a dedicated SIM slot at the side of the device, which replaces where you'd normally find the microSD slot.\n",
            "As England has been in a pandemic lockdown for months, I haven't ventured outside enough to really push the LTE connectivity to its limits, but I didn't find it impacted battery life too much in my limited tests.\n",
            "LTE connectivity is a great option to have on a device like the Surface Pro, especially for those who normally work remotely, visit clients, or just want something to replace really bad Wi-Fi connectivity.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "As with other Windows 10 computers, the Surface Pro 7 Plus presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup.\n",
            "The mandatory policies, for which agreement is required to use the laptop, are:\n",
            "In addition, there are a slew of optional things to agree to:\n",
            "Add it all up and you have two mandatory agreements and eleven optional ones.\n",
            "The other significant hardware change on the Surface Pro 7 Plus is removable SSDs.\n",
            "This is really designed for commercial users to swap out faulty SSDs or to retain corporate data.\n",
            "The SSD is easily accessible from an access door at the rear of the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and a simple SIM tool will open it up.\n",
            "Microsoft's reseller network has started selling SSD kits, with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options, so there's even the option to upgrade storage space here.\n",
            "It's encouraging to see Microsoft make this so easy to do, which makes it far quicker for IT admins to get a machine up and running again.\n",
            "All of these internal hardware changes also mean that Microsoft has managed to squeeze a bigger battery (46.5Wh to 50.4Wh) inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus.\n",
            "The company now promises 15 hours of battery life, compared to the 10.5 hours on the original Surface Pro 7.\n",
            "I haven't noticed any drastic improvements in battery life during normal usage, though.\n",
            "I typically got around seven to eight hours of battery life during my testing, which includes a mix of apps ranging from Chrome, Discord, and Netflix to Adobe Photoshop.\n",
            "If all you're doing is watching videos, then you'll probably see closer to Microsoft's 15-hour promise, but realistically this is still just enough to get you through a regular day of work.\n",
            "I'm still hoping that one day a Surface Pro will reliably hit 10 hours, so I never have to worry about traveling without a charger.\n",
            "I'm still a big fan of the Surface Pro, despite the lack of design changes.\n",
            "Microsoft is clearly catering to a specific audience here, and the Surface Pro 7 Plus has been built for businesses.\n",
            "I hope that means we'll soon see a consumer-focused Surface Pro that mixes everything that's great about the Surface Pro X with the power and performance of Intel's chips.\n",
            "Built-in LTE and removable SSDs are great additions to the Surface Pro lineup, but we've still been waiting years for basics like Thunderbolt 3 support.\n",
            "And while LTE is a great option to have once again, it's odd that Microsoft isn't including more futureproof 5G connectivity.\n",
            "If you're using an older Surface Pro and looking to upgrade, it might not look like a lot has changed over the years, but these subtle hardware changes do make a small difference.\n",
            "Microsoft completely redesigned the inside of the Surface Pro this year to include this LTE support and removable SSDs.\n",
            "I'm just hoping a complete redesign on the outside is on the way.\n",
            "It's still the 2-in-1 to beat, but the Surface Pro could offer so much more.\n",
            "Today, you can upgrade a desktop PC's gaming performance just by plugging in a new graphics card.\n",
            "What if you could do the same exact thing with everything else in that computer — slotting in a cartridge with a new CPU, memory, storage, even a new motherboard and set of ports?\n",
            "What if that new “everything else in your computer” card meant you could build an upgradable desktop gaming PC far smaller than you'd ever built or bought before?\n",
            "Last week, I visited Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, California so I could stop imagining and check out the NUC 9 Extreme for myself.\n",
            "The Intel NUC 9 Extreme, aka Ghost Canyon, is smack dab at the intersection of two ideas the chipmaker has been pursuing for years.\n",
            "Since 2012, the company's been building barebones desktop computers called NUCs (short for “Next Unit of Computing”) that are typically so tiny, you could fit one anywhere.\n",
            "And in 2015, Intel started working on an idea called the Compute Card to easily upgrade the brains of a PC by swapping in a new CPU cartridge.\n",
            "But the Compute Card was a commercial failure, and the NUC was only ever as powerful as its onboard graphics could manage.\n",
            "But in 2018, after Intel conducted a freak experiment that put AMD graphics inside an Intel processor, the company proved that a NUC could be powerful enough for gamers as well — and starting wondering what it'd be like to build a fully upgradable version that could fit powerful desktop graphics cards, too.\n",
            "And while Intel was at it, the company resurrected the idea of a modular “brain” for the rest of the computer as well.\n",
            "The result is a desktop gaming PC that's just 5 liters in volume — slightly smaller than a PlayStation 4 Pro, and taking up less than half the 12 liter volume of a Corsair One, one of our favorite pre-built compact gaming PC designs, and yet with enough space to fit a desktop-grade Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU.\n",
            "Besides, its “NUC Element” modular CPU cartridge could make it even easier to upgrade than computers with far more space to work inside.\n",
            "It just takes two screws to open the lid, with its twin 80mm exhaust fans and spring-loaded copper connectors — there's no fan cable to unplug — plus half a dozen cables to dislodge, including snaps for a pair of Wi-Fi antennas, the power cable, and cables for the front audio, USB ports, and full-size SD card reader.\n",
            "Then push a lever, and the computer's entire brain lifts right out — a graphics card-shaped brain that houses practically every critical part of the system save the modified 500W FlexATX power supply.\n",
            "Pop open the NUC Element module after two more screws, and you'll find an L-shaped vapor chamber cooler for the 45W Core i5, i7, or i9-9980HK CPU (laptop grade, but one of the fastest Intel makes); an 80mm blower-style fan and heat sink to dissipate the heat; two standard DDR4 laptop memory module slots; and two slots for stick-shaped M.2 NVMe solid state drives — just load it up with whatever you like.\n",
            "Around back there's an Intel Wi-Fi 6 module baked right in, plus a full array of ports including four USB 3.1 jacks, two Thunderbolt 3 ports, dual Gigabit Ethernet sockets, and an HDMI port.\n",
            "That's a fairly comprehensive array of ports today, but it's neat to think that the next time you upgrade the CPU cartridge, it'd come with the latest and greatest ports as well.\n",
            "Right next to the CPU brain is a second PCIe x16 slot where your gaming graphics card goes, and you should know it won't fit every card — you'll be looking for a “mini” GPU like a GeForce RTX 2070 Mini that's less than eight inches in length.\n",
            "And it's a little cramped in such a tiny case, with the graphics card practically blocking the CPU fan's intake, so I'm curious if a gaming system would be able to maintain full performance for hours on end.\n",
            "But it never dipped beneath a butter-smooth 60+ frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at max settings on a 2560 x 1440 monitor with surprisingly little fan noise during an early test — pretty impressive for a PC barely wider than two graphics cards side by side.\n",
            "The bigger question is whether you'll actually be able to upgrade such a system for years to come.\n",
            "While practically every other part of the system is easily upgradable with off-the-shelf parts, the NUC Element modules themselves are proprietary and their CPUs are soldered down, meaning you'd need to rely on Intel to keep making them for the foreseeable future, and Intel isn't promising to do that for sure.\n",
            "But the company says there are currently at least two years of upgrades on the road map and it's hoping to see more — and perhaps more importantly, Intel has actual partners promising to take up the modular torch.\n",
            "Razer and Cooler Master have both confirmed they'll be selling their own complete turnkey gaming rigs later this year based on the NUC Element module, but with standard SFX power supplies and room for larger graphics cards than Intel's own box, as well as their very own distinct NUC Element enclosures.\n",
            "You'll be able to buy Intel's board separately and stick it into one.\n",
            "Both Cooler Master and Razer are notable partners because they're new to the desktop market; Intel's move means a PC parts vendor can now sell entire computers.\n",
            "Plus, Intel says other vendors are signing up to sell its own Ghost Canyon box as a complete system as well — and there's even a second version of the NUC, dubbed Quartz Canyon, that'll offer Intel Xeon processor modules to businesses that need them.\n",
            "Intel NUC marketing manager Bruce Patterson freely admits that his team's original modular Compute Card was a failure.\n",
            "“For most cases it required so much effort from the other partners to integrate it and make it work, it just wasn't worth it for most of our partners,” he tells me at Intel HQ.\n",
            "And while he considers Intel's NUC program a success with 20+ percent growth year over year, he says we're talking about a few million devices sold over the lifetime of the NUC.\n",
            "But already, it feels like there's more momentum behind this new NUC than this team's projects have ever had before, and it makes me wonder if CPU cartridges might actually take off this time around — if perhaps Intel has hit on a new standard that could change the way the industry builds powerful small form factor PCs from here on out.\n",
            "Either way, it's seriously impressive how much power Intel has crammed into a tiny upgradable box.\n",
            "I want one.\n",

            "Alienware has announced the second generation of its flagship Area-51m gaming laptop, the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "It's largely similar on the outside to the original Area-51m, but the specs are almost completely overhauled on the inside, with 10th Gen Intel processors, new Nvidia GPUs, faster RAM, and better display options.\n",
            "All of those upgrades will be limited to the new R2 model, though.\n",
            "Despite Alienware's goals for future-proofed upgradable parts, the Area-51m has failed to live up to its potential.\n",
            "One of the biggest draws of the Area-51m was the option for user-replaceable parts.\n",
            "Most modern laptops have nearly all of their internal components sealed in place in an effort to cut down on size.\n",
            "But the Area-51m took a different approach.\n",
            "It was big, easy to disassemble, and made it simple to replace nearly every internal component, from RAM to the CPU to the GPU to even the thermal cooling components.\n",
            "The idea was to make something more portable than any other desktop but more customizable than any laptop.\n",
            "Alienware's parent company, Dell, even built its own system for replaceable GPUs in laptops, called DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) to make it easier to upgrade in the future.\n",
            "It's an idea that Dell would later make good on by selling replacement RTX 2070 and 2080 modules for users who had initially bought the less powerful GTX 1660Ti or RTX 2060 cards and decided that they wanted an upgrade.\n",
            "Admittedly, upgrading from one GPU to another within the same family isn't what most people do with gaming PCs.\n",
            "To be fair to Alienware, back when it launched the Area-51m, the company never outright promised that it would offer new GPUs — only that customers would be able to upgrade within the selection of cards already on offer.\n",
            "The company even told The Verge at the time that it'd “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.”\n",
            "But now, with the launch of the Area-51m R2, there are new GPUs that use the DGFF format.\n",
            "According to Dell, the “Area-51m R1 only supports GPU upgrades within its current generation of graphics cards.” In other words: you can upgrade to the already-available RTX 2070 and 2080 through upgrade kits but not the new RTX 2070 Super and 2080 Super options that are shipping with the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "You also can't upgrade the processor in the R1 model to the new 10th Gen chips that are being offered on the R2 model; like the GPU, customers can only upgrade within the existing array of 9th Gen chips that the R1 shipped with, despite the fact that the Area-51m uses standard desktop sockets.\n",
            "Not all of this is on Alienware.\n",
            "Intel, for example, changed the socket specifications for its new 10th Gen desktop chips, making them incompatible with older motherboards that work with the 9th Gen lineup — like the Area-51m R1.\n",
            "But it highlights the limitations of taking a desktop-style approach to a single laptop: desktop PC owners can easily upgrade their motherboards if they want to take advantage of Intel's latest hardware while retaining most (if not all) of their PC's parts.\n",
            "That's not an option that's available to Area-51m owners.\n",
            "It's hard to look at the Area-51m as anything but a failed experiment.\n",
            "The Area-51m was supposed to offer the best parts of desktop gaming PCs and portable gaming laptops in a single device.\n",
            "Instead, with its hefty price tag and limited upgradability, it's ended up as a series of compromises that emphasize the worst limitations of both categories.\n",
            "Dell is being sued in California over its claims that its Alienware Area-51m R1 laptop would offer “unprecedented upgradeability,” Tom's Hardware reports.\n",
            "Alienware customer Robert Felter is accusing the company of running a “false and misleading” marketing campaign, in which it promised that the laptop's core components, including the CPU and GPU, could be swapped out for more powerful models.\n",
            "A year later, the Area-51m R1's successor was announced with new components not available as upgrades for the original model.\n",
            "“Consumers were misled by Dell's false and misleading marketing campaign and paid a significant premium for the Area 51M R1 under the incorrect belief that this ‘unprecedented upgradeability' would save them money in the long run by allowing them to upgrade their laptop's Core Components rather than having to purchase an entirely new upgraded laptop,” the suit alleges.\n",
            "Dell announced the Alienware Area 51-m R1 at CES 2019.\n",
            "The laptop offered a variety of 8th and 9th Gen Intel CPU options (including the i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K processors) and graphics cards including Nvidia's RTX 2070 and 2080.\n",
            "However, when the Area-51m R2 was announced the following May, it offered 10th Gen Intel CPUs and new GPUs including the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super not available as upgrades for the R1.\n",
            "If you go back and look at the specific promises Dell made when it announced the original laptop, it doesn't seem to have technically broken any of them.\n",
            "It said the laptop would only support Intel CPUs that used its Z390 chipset, which was compatible with the 8th and 9th-generation processors in the original R1 laptop.\n",
            "However, when Dell announced the R2, the new 10th-generation Intel CPUs used a new 400-series chipset.\n",
            "Considering it was Intel's decision to change its chipset, this decision was arguably out of Dell's hands.\n",
            "Meanwhile, when it comes to upgrades for the laptop's graphics card, Dell told The Verge at the time of the R1's announcement that it'd “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.” Effectively, customers could upgrade a lower end version of the laptop to a higher-end model, but only within the same generation of components.\n",
            "That left customers who bought the top-end model out of luck when a new generation of components rolled around.\n",
            "The suit alleges that Dell should have been aware that Intel and Nvidia's unannounced products wouldn't work with the laptop.\n",
            "It claims Dell works closely with both companies, and that it should know the specs of their products prior to them becoming public.\n",
            "“Yet, despite being in possession of such designs, and with the full knowledge that the design of the Area 51M R1 could not accommodate future NVIDIA and INTEL chipsets, Dell launched a global campaign to mislead the public that the Area 51M R1 was upgradeable,” it says.\n",
            "The question now is whether that means Dell's claims about “unprecedented upgradeability” (which are still live on its website) were misleading.\n",

            "“They also never disclosed that those with the highest spec CPU and/or GPU that their device would not be upgradeable.”\n",
            "Dell declined to comment to Tom's Hardware on the lawsuit, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.\n",

            "The photo comes from 9to5Google, and for the most part, it looks almost identical to the Versa 3 — except if you zero in on the right-hand side, where you can see a teeny little raised button.\n",
            "It might not seem like it, but this is actually a significant design change.\n",
            "Earlier iterations of the Versa — one of Fitbit's most popular devices — had a physical side button.\n",
            "Then, with the Versa 3 in 2020, Fitbit did away with it in favor of a smooth indentation.\n",
            "This was technically a “button,” but it wasn't something you could actually press in a traditional sense.\n",
            "Instead, when you squeezed it correctly, the Versa 3 would vibrate.\n",
            "The Fitbit Sense, which came out the same year, also shared the same design.\n",
            "On the surface, this seemed sensible.\n",
            "In theory, no buttons meant no accidental presses and a sleeker profile.\n",
            "In reality, it made for a crappy user experience.\n",
            "If you use too little pressure on the Sense or Versa 3's button, it won't do anything.\n",
            "And if you use too much pressure, it still might not do anything.\n",
            "Or, instead of waking the screen as you intended, you might end up triggering the long-press shortcut instead.\n",
            "For whatever reason, the top half of the button tended to be more responsive than the bottom.\n",
            "If you peruse Fitbit and Reddit forums, you'll find plenty of customers griping and sharing tips on how to make this button work.\n",
            "This isn't a new problem.\n",
            "There are plenty of fitness trackers that don't have any kind of button or crown.\n",
            "Instead, they rely on touchscreens entirely.\n",
            "For instance, with the Garmin Vivosmart 3 and Vivosmart 4, you had to tap the screen to confirm your choices.\n",
            "That meant nailing the perfect cadence and pressure each time.\n",
            "If you didn't master it, it meant a simple two-second task could end up taking several minutes to figure out.\n",
            "And while the Garmin Vivosmart devices are the example I'm using here, there are several touchscreen-only fitness bands out there with the same problems.\n",
            "Sweaty fingers are also an issue.\n",
            "Touchscreens often don't register moist fingers, and they also make it harder to use capacitive buttons.\n",
            "The irony is these are devices meant to be worn while exercising, so they effectively become harder to use just when you need them most.\n",
            "A well-designed physical button is a simple solution to all these problems.\n",
            "When you see a physical button, you don't have to learn how to use it.\n",
            "You just press and it does the thing you want.\n",
            "If you want to get fancy, you can program nifty shortcuts — like pausing your music — and never have to look down at your watch.\n",
            "A physical button does not care how sweaty your fingers are.\n",
            "It will always do its job.\n",
            "I recently reviewed the Garmin Vivosmart 5, and one small change ended up being a game-changer in a tracker series that was always finicky.\n",
            "That change?\n",
            "Adding a physical button.\n",
            "The combination of a touchscreen and a button was perfect.\n",
            "I could use the touchscreen when it made sense, like when scrolling through menus.\n",
            "But I could also always rely on the button to get me back to the homescreen, the previous screen, or end a workout.\n",
            "Adding the button single-handedly eliminated one of the tracker series' worst pain points.\n",
            "This is the most likely reason why — if this leaked photo is to be believed — Fitbit has backpedaled to an older design.\n",
            "It's a smart decision if so, and it's further proof that you get the best wearable experience when you use both a touchscreen and physical buttons.\n",
            "Unfortunately, it shipped with buggy software that made everything look bad.\n",
            "Apple told us that it wasn't “behaving as expected” and promised us a software update.\n",
            "That update is now here, sort of.\n",
            "You have to update your Mac to the public beta of macOS Monterey 12.4, which comes with a further update to the Studio Display.\n",
            "(Once the Studio Display is updated, the improvements are available when connected to any other Mac, though.)\n",
            "I updated my review unit last night, and, basically, the changes are what Apple said we'd see: the noise reduction is improved, contrast is better, and the framing is slightly wider.\n",
            "Here's a side by side:\n",
            "It's not going to blow anyone's mind, but it's definitely not as immediately broken-looking as before.\n",
            "There's a little more detail in my face, less noise in the background, and the colors are definitely more accurate.\n",
            "(I look like I have actually seen the sun in the past year.)\n",
            "It does seem like Apple's decision to put a wide-angle lens on this camera for Center Stage support is working against image quality here — no matter what, it's cropping down that sensor, giving the whole system less data to work with.\n",
            "The update is still in beta, so we'll see if Apple changes anything else when macOS 12.4 actually ships, which should be relatively soon.\n",
            "When that happens, we'll take a closer look and update our review appropriately.\n",
            "Whether you're wearing them for the morning commute, while traveling, or if you're simply trying to find some peace and quiet while working at home, noise-canceling headphones are a more essential piece of kit nowadays than ever before.\n",
            "And you've got a slew of great options to pick from.\n",
            "No matter how you're using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven't changed: the most important measures are comfort, how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, and whether they support multipoint pairing so you can connect to two audio sources at once.\n",
            "The right headphones for you will differ based on which of those things you prioritize, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones is Sony's WH-1000XM4.\n",
            "They offer a good mix of sound quality, everyday durability, and great noise cancellation.\n",
            "Sony's 1000XM4 headphones improve on their popular predecessors with new features like multipoint pairing and automatic speech detection.\n",
            "They retain the same excellent comfort and top-notch sound quality.\n",
            "But if you're looking for something a bit different, there are still plenty of options.\n",
            "If you want supreme comfort during those long-haul flights, Bose's QuietComfort 45s are the answer.\n",
            "If you're an iPhone owner and will only settle for the best, the AirPods Max live up to their price.\n",
            "But Sennheiser and Shure also sell some tremendous ANC headphones if sound quality is your main focus.\n",
            "Trying to find the best headphones for Zoom life?\n",
            "Microsoft and Bose both have strong contenders.\n",
            "And if you're after something a little more stylish, Marshall's headphones just might surprise you.\n",
            "Sony's WH-1000XM4 might look identical to the previous 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours.\n",
            "Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings.\n",
            "Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it's still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the marathon 30-hour battery life.\n",
            "But Sony addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued into what's happening on your phone when you're working away on your laptop or tablet.\n",
            "Sony also has a really unique trick for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you've started talking, which is handy when you're grabbing a coffee.\n",
            "And unlike their predecessors, the 1000XM4s can tell when they've been removed from your ears for auto-pause.\n",
            "However, if you're not in a rush, rumors indicate that Sony's next flagship noise-canceling headphones could be right around the corner.\n",
            "Bose's QC45 headphones are a return to form in the best way.\n",
            "They have a design that's very similar to the QC35II, meaning they're remarkably light and comfortable on your head even when worn for an entire day.\n",
            "The oval ear cups never fatigue your ears, and no one can match Bose when it comes to comfort.\n",
            "Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded to make them easier to travel with.\n",
            "Bose's QuietComfort 45 headphones update the company's popular, impossibly comfortable design with USB-C, improved noise cancellation, and longer battery life.\n",
            "Bose made modest improvements to the active noise cancellation and stretched battery life to 24 hours from the previous 20.\n",
            "The QC45s also have a USB-C port instead of the Micro USB connector of their predecessors.\n",
            "And they add a transparency mode for when you need to have a quick chat with someone or want more awareness of your surroundings.\n",
            "Sound quality on the QC45s is a little more even-handed than the bassy Sony 1000XM4s.\n",
            "But you can switch up the default sound: Bose added the ability to customize EQ in a firmware update in February 2022.\n",
            "One frustration that remains is that there's no way to turn off noise cancellation without activating the transparency mode.\n",
            "It's one or the other with no basic “off” mode.\n",
            "I'm still hoping Bose will address both of these shortcomings with future software updates, but you shouldn't count on that.\n",
            "The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations.\n",
            "But Apple's build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you'll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric.\n",
            "They're hefty headphones, there's no denying that.\n",
            "But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there's nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap.\n",
            "And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes.\n",
            "Apple's AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation.\n",
            "The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver the best audio quality you can get from high-end Bluetooth headphones.\n",
            "They have an immersive, wide soundstage, fantastic dynamics, and you'll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs.\n",
            "Apple's noise cancellation is right up there with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you're not wearing headphones at all.\n",
            "Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow that daunting price.\n",
            "But the AirPods Max do have faults.\n",
            "The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they're designed with Apple's ecosystem in mind.\n",
            "If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation.\n",
            "Sennheiser's Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort.\n",
            "The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC.\n",
            "Sennheiser's premium noise-canceling headphones offer lush comfort, rich sound with plenty of bass, and a timeless design.\n",
            "If you're a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C.\n",
            "They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials.\n",
            "Their noise-canceling isn't on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.\n",
            "Shure is best known for its earbuds, but the Aonic 50 are a fantastic set of noise-canceling headphones that support both Bluetooth and wired audio through 3.5mm or USB-C.\n",
            "With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made noticeable improvements to sound quality and battery life.\n",
            "After you've gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you'll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again.\n",
            "Microsoft's Surface Headphones 2 have the same intuitive dial controls as the originals for volume and noise cancellation, but the sequel offer better sound quality and battery life at a cheaper price.\n",
            "The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you're at work on your PC.\n",
            "Something about the way Microsoft handles simultaneous Bluetooth connections seems more reliable and consistent than what everyone else is doing.\n",
            "It's rare that I encounter any bugs when connected to two devices at once.\n",
            "It's hard to oversell this benefit during work-at-home life, and you get the convenience for much less cash than the Sony or Bose headphones.\n",
            "Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned.\n",
            "They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness.\n",
            "It's really a flip of the coin between these and Sony's 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many.\n",
            "Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose's support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus.\n",
            "The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren't as feather-light as the company's less expensive QC35 II headphones.\n",
            "Bose's flagship noise-canceling headphones improve on the QC35IIs with a nicer design, better voice mics, and more control over the powerful noise cancellation.\n",
            "When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you'll be heard loud and clear by whoever's on the other end, which can't be said for all wireless headphones on this list.\n",
            "Bose's microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here.\n",
            "Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below.\n",
            "Marshall's wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company's most expensive pair is also its best yet.\n",
            "Marshall doesn't quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise.\n",
            "But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company's heritage.\n",
            "The headphones fold up for easy carrying, and Marshall's signature gold joystick makes the Monitor IIs simple to control.\n",
            "Marshall's noise-canceling headphones stand out for their unique look and easy-to-use joystick for controlling your music.\n",
            "They're also a battery life champ with up to up to 45 hours of playback.\n",
            "They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you're already someplace quiet and can do without the feature.\n",
            "That impressive longevity beats our primary picks.\n",
            "A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I've enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I've put them on.\n",
            "They're more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones.\n",
            "The story of this year's Google I/O actually started three years ago.\n",
            "At I/O 2019, onstage at the Shoreline Auditorium in Mountain View, California, Rick Osterloh, Google's SVP of devices and services, laid out a new vision for the future of computing.\n",
            "“In the mobile era, smartphones changed the world,” he said.\n",
            "“It's super useful to have a powerful computer wherever you are.” But he described an even more ambitious world beyond that, where your computer wasn't a thing in your pocket at all.\n",
            "It was all around you.\n",
            "It was everything.\n",
            "“Your devices work together with services and AI, so help is anywhere you want it, and it's fluid.\n",
            "The technology just fades into the background when you don't need it.\n",
            "So the devices aren't the center of the system — you are.” He called the idea “ambient computing,” nodding to a concept that has floated around Amazon, Apple, and other companies over the last few years.\n",
            "One easy way to interpret ambient computing is around voice assistants and robots.\n",
            "Put Google Assistant in everything, yell at your appliances, done and done.\n",
            "But that's only the very beginning of the idea.\n",
            "The ambient computer Google imagines is more like a guardian angel or a super-sentient Star Wars robot.\n",
            "It's an engine that understands you completely and follows you around, churning through and solving for all the stuff in your life.\n",
            "The small (when's my next appointment?)\n",
            "and the big (help me plan my wedding) and the mundane (turn the lights off) and the life-changing (am I having a heart attack?).\n",
            "The wheres and whens and hows don't matter, only the whats and whys.\n",
            "The ambient computer isn't a gadget — it's almost a being; it's the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts whole that comes out of a million perfectly-connected things.\n",
            "Which is a problem for Google.\n",
            "The company is famously decentralized and non-hierarchical, and it can sometimes seem like every single engineer on staff is given the green light to ship whatever they made that week.\n",
            "And so, since that day in 2019, Google has mostly continued to do what Google always does, which is build an unbelievable amount of stuff, often without any discernible strategy or plan behind it.\n",
            "It's not that Google didn't have a bigger vision; it's just that no one seemed to be interested in doing the connective work required for the all-encompassing, perfectly-connected future Osterloh had imagined.\n",
            "Google was becoming a warehouse full of cool stuff rather than an ecosystem.\n",
            "But over the last couple of years, Google has begun to change in order to meet this challenge.\n",
            "Osterloh's devices team, for instance, has completely reset its relationship with the Android team.\n",
            "For a long time, the company proudly maintained a wall between Pixel and Android, treating its internal hardware team like any other manufacturer.\n",
            "Now, Google treats Pixel like the tip of the spear: it's meant to be both a flagship device and a development platform through which Google can build features it then shares with the rest of the ecosystem.\n",
            "“We really sort of co-design where things are headed,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“I think that's just sort of the nature of how computers have changed, and computing models have changed.” Both teams share visions of an ambient future, he said.\n",
            "“And we're working on it together.”\n",
            "Around the company, these related teams and products are starting to come closer together.\n",
            "They're building on unified tech, like Google's custom Tensor processors, and on common concepts like conversational AI.\n",
            "As a result, Google I/O feels unusually… coherent this year.\n",
            "Google is trying — harder than I can remember — to build products that not only work well but work well together.\n",
            "Search is becoming a multisensory, multi-device proposition that understands both who's searching and what they're really looking for.\n",
            "It's also extending the search experience far beyond just questions and answers.\n",
            "It's making Android more context- and content-aware so that your phone changes to match the things you do on it.\n",
            "It's emphasizing natural interactions so that you can get information without memorizing a rigid set of commands.\n",
            "It's building the hardware ecosystem it needs to make all that work everywhere and the software to match.\n",
            "Now, let's be very clear: Google's work is only just beginning.\n",
            "It has to win market share in device categories it has failed for years to capture.\n",
            "It has to build new experiences inside new and old devices.\n",
            "It has to figure out how to solve Android fragmentation between its devices and the market-leading devices from companies like Samsung, which might be the hardest part of all.\n",
            "And it has to become more present in users' lives and extract more information from them, all without upsetting regulators, screwing up the search-ads business, or violating users' privacy.\n",
            "The ambient computer was never going to come easily, and Google has made its own efforts harder in countless ways over the years.\n",
            "But at the very least, the company seems to finally understand what an ambient computer requires — and why “it has Assistant!” is not a sufficient answer — and is beginning the work to get it done.\n",
            "When I sat down with Osterloh over a video call a few days before I/O, he began to wax poetic about Google's hardware division, every so often glancing down just out of frame.\n",
            "I asked what he was looking at, suddenly suspicious it was a bunch of unreleased devices.\n",
            "I was right.\n",
            "“This is Pixel 6,” he said, holding up his current device.\n",
            "“And then, I have a Pixel 6A, in a very disguised case,” this time holding up a black brick of rubber surrounding the unreleased device.\n",
            "“And I have a Pixel 7, also in disguise.” He held up his wrist, too, with a Pixel Watch strapped to it.\n",
            "As we talked, Osterloh reiterated the usual Google pitch for ambient computing, but this time, it came with a bit of a twist to the familiar.\n",
            "The long-term vision is still an always-there version of Google that works everywhere with everything all the time, but right now?\n",
            "Right now, it's still all about the ultra-fast processor in your pocket.\n",
            "“Certainly for the foreseeable future, we feel like the most crucial part of that is the pocketable computer, the mobile phone,” he said.\n",
            "The smartphone is the center of the computing universe for billions of users around the globe, and so the first version of Osterloh's ambient computer will be built around a smartphone, too.\n",
            "“The target of what Pixel is, is about having an awesome user experience that keeps getting better over time,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“And with that as the core, what you realize is like the thing that is essential to have across these devices is Tensor.”\n",
            "The Google-designed Tensor processor was the key feature introduced alongside the Pixel 6, largely as a way to improve its on-device AI capabilities for speech recognition and more.\n",
            "And now, it seems, it's going to be a staple of the line: Osterloh said all the upcoming Pixel phones — and even the Android-powered tablet the team is working on for release next year — will run on its Tensor processor.\n",
            "The smartphone is the center of the universe for now, but you can already start to see how that might change.\n",
            "The new Pixel Buds Pro are a powerful set of noise-canceling headphones, for instance, but also a hands-free interface into a wirelessly connected computing device.\n",
            "“Devices that can be close to your ear and enable you to have real-time communication with the computer are an absolutely essential part of ambient computing,” Osterloh said, noting that he now does most of his emailing via voice.\n",
            "Similarly, the new Pixel Watch is, in some ways, a phone accessory, delivering notifications and the like to your wrist and offering another interface to the same power in your pocket.\n",
            "But Google's also selling an LTE version, so you'll be able to access Assistant or pay with Google Wallet without needing your phone nearby.\n",
            "And that tablet, whenever it comes, will have all the same Pixel capabilities in a bigger shell.\n",
            "The point is that it doesn't matter, in the long run, which device you use.\n",
            "“Where the computing capability is, and how powerful the devices themselves are, shouldn't matter to the user,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“I think what they should see is increasing capabilities.”\n",
            "The Pixel and Android teams have recently adopted a sort of mantra: Better Together.\n",
            "Much of what's new this year in Android 13 is not whizbang new features but small tweaks meant to make the ecosystem a little more seamless.\n",

            "Support for the Matter smart home standard now comes built into Android, which should make setting up and controlling new devices much easier.\n",
            "Google's extending support for its Cast protocols for sending audio and video to other devices and improving its Fast Pair services to make it easy to connect Bluetooth devices.\n",
            "It has been talking about these features since CES in January and has signed up an impressive list of partners.\n",
            "It sounds a bit like Google finally watched an Apple ad and discovered that making hardware and software together really does help.\n",
            "Who knew!\n",
            "But Google's position is genuinely tricky here.\n",
            "Google's ad business relies on a mind-bendingly huge scale, which it gets mostly thanks to other companies building Android products.\n",
            "That means Google has to keep all those partners happy and feeling like they're on a level playing field with the Pixel team.\n",
            "And it simply can't control its ecosystem like Apple can.\n",
            "It is forever worrying about backward compatibility and how things will work on devices of all sizes, prices, and power.\n",
            "It has to engender support to make big changes, whereas Apple just brute-forces the future.\n",
            "But Google has become increasingly bold in pushing ahead with the Pixel brand.\n",
            "It can afford to because Pixel is hardly a real sales threat to Samsung and others.\n",
            "(Besides, where are Android manufacturers going to go?\n",
            "Windows Mobile?)\n",
            "But it also has to because Google only wins if the ecosystem buys in, and Pixel is Google's best chance to model what the entire Android ecosystem should look like.\n",
            "That's what Osterloh sees as his job and, in large part, his team's reason for being.\n",
            "If Pixel's never going to be a smash-hit bestseller (and it looks like it won't be), the only way Google can win in the long run is to use it as a way to pressure Samsung and others to keep up Google's features and ideas.\n",
            "Google has a chance to lead even more in tablets and smartwatches, two Android markets in desperate need of a path forward.\n",
            "“Phone is certainly super important,” said Sameer Samat, a VP of product management on the Android team.\n",
            "“But it's also becoming very clear that there are other device form factors which are complementary and also critical to a consumer deciding which ecosystem to buy into, and which ecosystem to live.”\n",
            "That's another way of saying the only way Google can get to its ambient computing dreams is to make sure Google is everywhere.\n",
            "Like, literally everywhere.\n",
            "That's why Google continues to invest in products in seemingly every square inch of your life, from your TV to your thermostat to your car to your wrist to your ears.\n",
            "The ambient-computing future may be one computer to rule them all, but that computer needs a near-infinite set of user interfaces.\n",
            "The second step to making ambient computing work is to make it really, really easy to use.\n",
            "Google is relentlessly trying to whittle away every bit of friction involved in accessing its services, particularly the Assistant.\n",
            "For instance, if you own a Nest Hub Max, you'll soon be able to talk to it just by looking into its camera, and you'll be able to set timers or turn off the lights without issuing a command at all.\n",
            "“It's kind of like you and I having a conversation,” said Nino Tasca, a director of product management on Google's speech team.\n",
            "“Sometimes, I'll use your name to start a conversation.\n",
            "But if I'm already staring at you and ask you directly, you know I'm talking to you.” Google is obsessed with making everything natural and conversational because it's convinced that making it easy is actually more important than making it fast.\n",
            "The same logic applies to search, which is quickly becoming a multi-sensory, multi-modal thing.\n",
            "“The way you search for information shouldn't be constrained to typing keywords into a search box,” said Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's SVP for knowledge and information products.\n",
            "“Our vision is to make the whole world around you searchable, so you can find helpful information about whatever you see, hear and experience, in whichever ways are most natural to you.”\n",
            "That has forced Google to reinvent both the input of search, leaning on voice and images just as much as the text box, as well as the output.\n",
            "“Some people really find it easy to process video,” said Liz Reid, a VP of engineering on the search team, “and other people will find it distracting.\n",
            "On the other hand, some people's literacy is not as good, and so a long web page that you have to read through not only takes time, but they're gonna get lost, and a video that's spoken in their language is really intuitive.” Google built one hell of a text box, but it's not enough anymore.\n",
            "The most obvious outpouring of that work is multisearch.\n",
            "Using the Google app, you can take a photo of a dress — in Google's examples, it's always a dress — and then type “green” to search for that dress but in green.\n",
            "That's the kind of thing you just couldn't do in a text box.\n",
            "And at I/O, Google also showed off a tool for running multisearch on an image with multiple things in it: take a picture of the peanut butter aisle, type “nut-free,” and Google will tell you which one to buy.\n",
            "“We find when we unlock new capabilities that people had information needs that were just too hard to express,” Reid said.\n",
            "“And then they start expressing them on there.” Search used to be one thing, Lens was another, voice was a third, but when you combine them, new things become possible.\n",
            "But the real challenge for Google is that it's much more than a question-and-answer engine now.\n",
            "“What's best isn't really, in many of these cases, a strict stack rank, right?” Reid said.\n",
            "“A lot of these newer use cases, there's a style or a taste component.” Shopping has become important to Google, for instance, but there's no single correct answer for “best t-shirt.” Plus, Google is using search more and more as a way to keep you inside Google's ecosystem; the search box is increasingly just a launcher to various Google things.\n",
            "So rather than just aiming to understand the internet, Google has to learn to understand its users better than ever.\n",
            "Does it help that Google has a massive store of first-party data that it has collected over the last couple of decades on billions of people around the world?\n",
            "Of course it does!\n",
            "But even that isn't enough to get Google where it's going.\n",
            "About the ads: don't forget the fact that even in a world outside the search box, Google's still an advertising business.\n",
            "Just as Amazon's ambient computing vision seems to always come back to selling you things, Google's will always come back to showing you ads.\n",
            "And the thing about Google's whole vision is that it means a company that knows a lot about you and seems to follow you everywhere… will know even more about you and follow you even more places.\n",
            "Google seems to be going out of its way to try and make users feel comfortable with its presence: it's moving more AI to devices themselves instead of processing and storing everything in the cloud, it's pushing toward new systems of data collection that don't so cleanly identify an individual, and it's offering users more ways to control their own privacy and security settings.\n",
            "But the ambient-computer life requires a privacy tradeoff all the same, and Google is desperate to make it good enough that it's worth it.\n",
            "That's a high bar and getting higher all the time.\n",
            "Actually, this whole process is full of high bars for Google.\n",
            "If it wants to build an ambient computer that can truly be all things to all people, it's going to need to build a sweeping ecosystem of hugely popular devices that all run compatible software and services while also seamlessly integrating with a massive global ecosystem of other devices, including those made by its direct competitors.\n",
            "And that's just to build the interface.\n",
            "Past that, Google has to turn the Assistant into something genuinely pleasurable to interact with all day and make its services flex to every need and workflow of users across the globe.\n",
            "Nothing about that will be easy.\n",
            "But if you squint a little, you can see what it would look like.\n",
            "And that's what has been so frustrating about Google's approach in recent years: it feels like all the puzzle pieces to the future are sitting there in Mountain View, strewn around campus with no one paying attention.\n",
            "But now, as a company, Google appears to be starting to assemble them.\n",
            "The world has been gifted the second photograph ever taken of a supermassive black hole — and this time, it's a black hole that's relatively close to home.\n",
            "Today, scientists collaborating on the massive Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project released an image of Sagittarius A*, the gargantuan black hole spinning away at the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n",
            "This celestial present comes from the same project which made quite the splash back in 2019 when they released the very first image taken of a black hole.\n",
            "That now iconic fuzzy orange photo showcased a supermassive black hole at the heart of a mammoth galaxy called Messier 87, or M87, which is located 55 million light-years from Earth.\n",
            "The groundbreaking result helped scientists verify the circular shape of these objects as well as further confirm Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which predicted the existence of black holes.\n",
            "Now, the team is back with another photo of a black hole, this one right in our own backyard.\n",
            "Located 26,000 light-years from Earth, Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A*, is thought to be roughly 4 million times the mass of our Sun.\n",
            "Scientists have inferred its existence at the center of our galaxy for decades based on how objects move around the black hole.\n",
            "But this is the first time we have a direct image of its dark central area, or “shadow,” even more proof of life of the nexus of our cosmic neighborhood.\n",
            "“Until now, we didn't have the direct picture confirming that Sgr A* was indeed a black hole,” Feryal Özel, an astronomer at the University of Arizona and member of EHT, said during a press conference announcing the news.\n",
            "She added, “This image shows a bright ring surrounding the darkness — the telltale sign of the shadow of the black hole.”\n",
            "With each new supermassive black hole picture we get, scientists learn a little bit more about these enigmatic objects.\n",
            "“These supermassive black holes, we don't really know how they formed or grew so large,” Meredith Clark Powell, a black hole researcher at Stanford University, tells The Verge.\n",
            "“So it's a very active area of research.”\n",
            "Truthfully, one cannot capture an image of a black hole directly.\n",
            "Black holes, by their very nature, can't be “seen,” as these objects are so massive that nothing can escape their gravitational pull — including light.\n",
            "Instead, we can capture the silhouette of a black hole.\n",
            "If a supermassive black hole is surrounded by a swirling disc of gas and dust, that material will glow bright since the gas and dust is sped up and heated by the powerful gravitational pull of the nearby hole.\n",
            "What EHT is actually capturing is the black hole's shadow against the backdrop of that glowing gas and dust.\n",
            "Snapping pictures of these black hole shadows is no simple task, though.\n",
            "To capture an image like this of Sagittarius A*, a single telescope would have to be the size of planet Earth to get the job done, according to the Event Horizon Telescope group.\n",
            "Since building such an apparatus isn't exactly realistic, scientists came up with a workaround.\n",
            "The EHT is a wide-ranging array of radio dishes spread out across five different continents.\n",
            "The radio telescopes all work together to observe the same object, behaving as if they are one giant planet-sized telescope.\n",
            "It's then up to the EHT scientists to piece together the data the telescopes gathered to create a single image.\n",
            "EHT used the same technique to capture M87; eight EHT radio dishes spent a week observing that black hole in April 2017, which then resulted in months and months of work to compile the data into the image that was eventually released.\n",
            "At the same time, EHT also observed Sagittarius A*, but crafting its image proved to be much more challenging and time-consuming.\n",
            "“Taking a picture with the EHT is like listening to a song being played on a piano that has a lot of missing keys,” Katie Bouman, an astronomer at Caltech, said during the press conference.\n",
            "Though it's closer to Earth than M87's black hole, Sgr A* is smaller and less active, and the material surrounding the object is much dimmer, making it harder to observe.\n",
            "On top of that, the material that does surround Sgr A* exhibits weird flaring when the particles surrounding the black hole are accelerated to much higher energies.\n",
            "While it makes for an interesting light show, it changes the composition of the black hole every few hours, making it tricky to observe over time.\n",
            "The material that swirls around Sgr A* close to the event horizon — the point of no return for the particles falling into the black hole — moves so incredibly fast that the object appears to change in real time.\n",
            "“That means as we were collecting data during the Earth's rotation, the material was swirling around Sgr A* so quickly that Sgr A*'s appearance could change from minute to minute,” Bouman said.\n",
            "In addition to all of that, Sgr A* is in our own galaxy, which makes it harder to see from Earth.\n",
            "Observing this black hole means peering through the galactic plane of the Milky Way — and all of the gaseous material in between us and the black hole.\n",
            "That provides a lot of interference that the scientists had to work around.\n",
            "“The result is an image that until we finished our analyses, we were never sure we could get,” Vincent Fish, an astronomer at the MIT Haystack Observatory and an EHT collaborator, said during the press conference.\n",
            "When the EHT scientists observed Sgr A*, they collected roughly 3.5 petabytes of data.\n",
            "“That's equivalent to about 100 million TikTok videos,” Fish said.\n",
            "“It's way too much data to stream over the internet.”\n",
            "The team had to transfer the information by shipping hundreds of hard drives to correlation centers in Westford, Massachusetts, and Bonn, Germany, according to Fish.\n",
            "There, supercomputers compiled the signals together.\n",
            "After that, the data underwent an intense calibration process, as the scientists attempted to construct the best image they could make of the black hole's silhouette and plasma.\n",
            "Part of this calibration process had to move online, too, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n",
            "The resulting image is the one that was unveiled today, though it may look a bit blurry to the average observer.\n",
            "That's simply due to the limitations of our instruments here on Earth.\n",
            "“Every telescope has something we call the diffraction limit,” Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said during the press conference.\n",
            "“It's the finest features that it can see, and that's basically the level that we're seeing here.”\n",
            "But, with this fuzzy image, the scientists have already learned a lot.\n",
            "For one thing, they've determined that Sgr A* isn't a particularly hungry black hole.\n",
            "Only a small portion of the material surrounding the object actually makes it inside.\n",
            "“If Sgr A* were a person it would consume a single grain of rice every million years,” Johnson said.\n",
            "Sgr A* also doesn't convert much of its gravitational energy into light.\n",
            "The gravitational pull of some black holes, like the one in the middle of M87, can actually speed up the surrounding plasma, causing the material to shoot outward as jets of light.\n",
            "That's not the case for Sgr A*, which is a much more quiet kind of black hole.\n",
            "And that kind of black hole may be the standard.\n",
            "“Sgr A* is giving us a view into the much more standard state of black holes, quiet and quiescent,” Johnson said.\n",
            "“M87 was exciting because it was extraordinary.\n",
            "Sgr A* is exciting because it's common.”\n",
            "Now, with two black hole images on its resume, the EHT collaboration has big plans for the future.\n",
            "EHT is adding even more telescopes with the goal of creating the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), Johnson said.\n",
            "This will potentially allow scientists to process a moving image of a black hole, showing how it evolves over time.\n",
            "“This improvement will help us move from these still images to capturing the first high resolution movies of black holes, letting us witness them in action and continuing this quest toward the boundary of the unknown,” Johnson said.\n",
            "Twitter is shaking up its top leadership.\n",
            "The first move came as consumer product leader Kayvon Beykpour announced on Twitter that current CEO Parag Agrawal “asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.” The New York Times reports that in an email to employees, Agrawal announced Bruce Falck, the general manager of revenue and head of product for its business side, is leaving.\n",
            "In the email he said the company is pausing most hiring and pulling back on spending, but is not currently planning layoffs.\n",

            "Even with the revamped design, the M5s weigh in at 250 grams, pretty much the same as the 254-gram M4s.\n",
            "Sony continues to offer them in black or off-white, and the latter has a subtle textured finish that hides finger oils and smudges better than the black model.\n",
            "But I'm not convinced that these headphones look very premium.\n",
            "The 1000XM4s at least had some visible metal on their ratcheting ear cup sliders, but everything you can see or touch on the 1000XM5s is all plastic.\n",
            "I wouldn't be concerned about durability: I twisted the hell out of these headphones and they held up perfectly fine.\n",
            "It's more about fit and finish.\n",
            "My Sennheiser Momentum 3s have a more impressive build quality that feels appropriate for their price.\n",
            "That said, it's possible to go too far in the other direction, too.\n",
            "You can make a good case that the AirPods Max are too heavy, and Sony is clearly prioritizing extended comfort above a lavish design.\n",
            "The ear cups still pivot and turn just as they did before.\n",
            "But one thing Sony's new headphones can't do anymore is fold.\n",
            "This is one of my biggest disappointments with the 1000XM5s.\n",
            "Instead of folding down for convenient portability, these headphones just lay flat in their case.\n",
            "And, as a result, that case is significantly larger than before.\n",
            "The 1000XM4 case is easy to toss in my bag, but the 1000XM5s don't fit in the usual compartment, so I've had to clumsily put them in the main part of the bag.\n",
            "You can always leave the case at home, but then you've got to be mindful of what else might be in your bag nudged up against the headphones.\n",
            "Even though it's collapsible without the headphones inside, this case is too bulky, and I think Sony could've done better.\n",
            "Bose's case for the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, which can't fold up either, is smaller and makes efficient use of space.\n",
            "People travel with these headphones constantly, and I think Sony's oversized case is going to cause frustration.\n",
            "But it's at least a functional case — hello, Apple — with storage for the USB-C and aux cables.\n",
            "Sony no longer includes a dual-prong airline adapter in the box.\n",
            "As for how the 1000XM5s sound, there are bigger changes than I was expecting.\n",
            "Sony has switched from 40-millimeter drivers in the 1000XM4s to 30-millimeter drivers in these new headphones.\n",
            "Driver size isn't everything, but I can't think of the last time a pair of Sony headphones sounded this different from their predecessors.\n",
            "The 1000XM5s are tighter, more detailed, and clean up the sometimes muddy bass of the 1000XM4s.\n",
            "“The new 30mm driver unit, with a light and rigid dome, uses carbon fiber composite material that improves high frequency sensitivity for more natural sound quality,” Sony spokesperson Chloe Canta told The Verge.\n",
            "More natural, yes, but they also have less oomph to them.\n",
            "They're less in your face and less potent out of the box overall.\n",
            "I've done direct comparisons with the same songs on both headphones, and the M5s won out in most cases.\n",
            "They're noticeably more refined, detailed, and spacious.\n",
            "But in some instances, particularly when listening to thumpy hip-hop or EDM tracks, I leaned towards the M4s.\n",
            "There are inevitably going to be people who prefer the more energetic sound of the 1000XM4s.\n",
            "And maybe that's partly why Sony is keeping them around; selling two headphones that are otherwise so similar wouldn't make much sense.\n",
            "You can use the EQ controls in Sony's Headphones Connect app on Android or iOS to bring the sound of these headphones closer together, but the best thing to do is try both of them yourself if possible.\n",
            "You can look at all the frequency curve charts you want, but this stuff is fundamentally subjective.\n",
            "Sony stuck with the same QN1 noise cancellation processor for the new headphones, but now it's also added in a second processor to dial up ANC even further.\n",
            "As a result, the company says noise cancellation performs similarly to the M4s on a plane but should be better at handling street noise and cutting down on nearby voices.\n",
            "That's been true in my experience.\n",
            "It's still not enough to completely silence the world if you're in a busy coffee shop, but it's an improvement over what was already fantastic noise cancellation.\n",
            "One minor hardware thing to note: Sony previously had an “optimize” button on the headphones that would adjust the ANC for factors like air pressure and fit — hairstyle, whether you wear glasses, etc.\n",
            "But now the button is gone, and Sony says the same optimization is all happening automatically in the background.\n",
            "I miss the button a little; it was a fun trick that only took a few seconds, but I can see why Sony ditched it for simplicity's sake.\n",
            "As for voice calls, Sony is going for broke.\n",
            "The 1000XM5s have eight microphones in total, and four of those are used for voice.\n",
            "Add that together with AI algorithm improvements for noise reduction on calls, and the M5s deliver a noticeable upgrade over the M4s in this department.\n",
            "They aren't a match for the standout LinkBuds or standard AirPods, but, for over-ear headphones, they're about the best you're going to find.\n",
            "Things get a bit dodgier if you're in a loud environment, but all headphones struggle in that scenario and the Sonys managed to keep my voice intelligible on calls and Zoom chats.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "Like any headphones, you can use Sony's WH-1000XM5 over Bluetooth without clicking through any agreements.\n",
            "But if you want to use the Headphones Connect app, which is essential for customizing the settings, EQ, and other features of the headphones, you're agreeing to:\n",
            "You can also opt in to letting Sony collect data from your usage of the Headphones Connect app, which the company says is for the purpose of improving its products and services.\n",
            "Together, you get three optional agreements.\n",
            "The 1000XM5s still support LDAC, Sony's codec for higher-quality wireless audio.\n",
            "And if you can't plug in, LDAC is the next best thing for listening to hi-res music on Apple Music, Amazon Music, and others.\n",
            "This only applies to Android, mind you; iPhone owners are still limited to the lower-bitrate AAC codec.\n",
            "These headphones also support multipoint, meaning you can connect to two devices at once.\n",
            "But unfortunately, Sony still makes you pick one advanced feature or the other: you can enable either LDAC or multipoint but not both at the same time.\n",
            "The 1000XM4s had the same restriction, which makes me think it might come down to Bluetooth bandwidth.\n",
            "Some core basics about the 1000XM5s remain unchanged.\n",
            "You control them with taps and swipes on the right ear cup.\n",
            "The old Sony hallmarks — like holding your hand over the right ear cup to briefly lower your music and boost the outside world — are still present.\n",
            "Same goes for features from the 1000XM4s, like “speak to chat,” where the headphones can detect when you're talking and automatically halt music and enter transparency mode.\n",
            "You can also lift the left ear cup (or remove the headphones entirely) to automatically pause your music.\n",
            "Battery life is the same 30 hours as before if you're using noise cancellation.\n",
            "If you turn all the extra bells and whistles off, you can stretch well beyond that.\n",
            "Now, I want to discuss some missed opportunities: the things I was hoping Sony might add this time around but still hasn't.\n",
            "First, it's getting silly that these expensive headphones can't work wirelessly with the PlayStation 5.\n",
            "They're both top-tier, headline Sony products, but you've still got to plug into the PS5 controller with a cable.\n",
            "Second, the USB-C port is still just for charging, when a number of other headphones let you use it for audio as well.\n",
            "And finally, the 1000XM5s aren't remotely water or sweat resistant: there's a little paper in the box that urges you to avoid getting them wet.\n",
            "I'm not under the impression that these are fitness headphones, but some progress and resistance to the elements would be great to see in the year 2022.\n",
            "Maybe a few of these points will be addressed by the time the 1000XM6s come along in another two years.\n",
            "The already best-in-class noise cancellation has been stepped up even further.\n",
            "These headphones sound clearer and more natural but also very different from their predecessors, which could prove divisive.\n",
            "If you've got a pair of 1000XM4s and are happy with them, there's zero reason to run out and upgrade.\n",
            "Those headphones can do everything these can.\n",
            "But if you're on an older pair of Sony cans — say the 1000XM2s or M3s and your battery is starting to give out, then these are a much better buy.\n",
            "You're getting multipoint and the best ANC Sony has achieved yet.\n",
            "I don't love that the price has gone up, and the case is a miss.\n",
            "For those reasons, you should do your own side-by-side comparisons with the M4s and potentially save some money.\n",
            "It seems like Sony got confused with what it wanted the 1000XM5s to be: they're a strange half-step between the 1000XM4s and luxury headphones like the AirPods Max.\n",
            "There's no major new feature or big headlining thing about them.\n",
            "But they're still damn good noise-canceling headphones.\n",

            "Google has wrapped up its two-hour-long I/O keynote, which was absolutely packed with news.\n",
            "We heard about AI, Android, and, of course, a plethora of Pixel hardware.\n",
            "Here are the biggest announcements we saw on Wednesday.\n",
            "The company seems to be flipping its usual script for this phone — previous A models have featured a camera comparable to the one found on Google's flagship Pixels but had weaker processors.\n",
            "The 6A, though, has the Pixel 6's Tensor chip and design but opts for a 12-megapixel camera versus the 50MP one on the standard 6.\n",
            "Oh, and despite the fact that Google released a two-minute ad about the Pixel 5A's headphone jack last year, the 6A doesn't have one.\n",
            "Womp womp.\n",
            "The Pixel Watch's hardware was thoroughly leaked, so it's no surprise that it's showing up on this list, but Google's finally given us a look at what the software will be like.\n",
            "The wearable will run an updated version of Wear OS 3 and will feature a Fitbit integration that lets you keep track of your health metrics.\n",
            "There are still some unanswered (and very important) questions about the watch, though: we don't know what kind of chip it'll be powered by nor do we know how much it'll cost.\n",
            "It's slated to launch later this fall alongside the Pixel 7.\n",
            "The next generation of Pixel phones is on the horizon.\n",
            "Here's a first look at the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro — equipped with a new generation of Google Tensor and a sleek design.\n",
            "Coming this fall.\n",
            "Oh right.\n",
            "Yes, Google teased the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro with a few renders, showing that the phones will have some slightly different camera cutouts and back panel.\n",
            "Like Google's current Pixels, the 7 and 7 Pro will have two and three cameras, respectively.\n",
            "The pink color will apparently be gone, though, so I'll never be happy again.\n",
            "Let's not beat around the bush here: Google has announced its version of Apple's AirPods Pro.\n",
            "Google says the Buds have a custom audio chip and that they'll support Bluetooth multipoint, letting them connect to two devices at once.\n",
            "That's a neat trick and one that's not particularly common in the earbud world.\n",
            "They'll also come in several colors, including black, red, and green, and will be available to preorder on July 21st.\n",
            "Google announced that it plans to release an Android-powered tablet next year to act as a “perfect companion for Pixel with a larger form factor.” The writing for this one has been on the wall for a while.\n",
            "(Android 12L focused on large-screen experiences, and there have been some tablet-related hires over in Mountain View.)\n",
            "But it's good to hear that Google is looking to get into tablets again.\n",
            "The only real hardware detail we have about Google's upcoming device is that it'll have a Tensor chip in it.\n",
            "Right at the end of its presentation, Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation.\n",
            "There are pretty much no details on whether this will be a product people can buy, but it's certainly interesting to see more hints of Google's plan for joining companies like Snap and Meta in the race to put AR on your face.\n",
            "As is often the case, Google's I/O presentation was chock-full of AI news.\n",
            "Perhaps the biggest is that it's going to start letting people test its language model.\n",
            "Not just anyone will be able to try out LaMDA 2, but eventually, Google hopes to bring the tech to search and its other products (though it wants to do so very slowly).\n",
            "There were a bunch of smaller AI-related stories as well.\n",
            "Google announced that its auto-generated translations are coming to YouTube on mobile, that you'll be able to just look at your Nest Hub Max and start talking to the assistant, and that your phone will be able to look at a shelf full of chocolate bars and pick one out for you based on what you're looking for.\n",
            "That last one Google described as “a supercharged Ctrl-F for the world around you.”\n",
            "The company's also expanding its multisearch feature, which lets you search along multiple axes.\n",
            "For example, you can give Google a picture of a specific type of cuisine you're looking for and ask it where you can find that nearby.\n",
            "Google had a whole set of security and privacy announcements, including plans for the My Ad Center interface: a hub that will let users customize the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic.\n",
            "It also said the company is focused on implementing additional security features for its products by default, in addition to the concept of “protected computing” to do more processing on-device rather than sending data elsewhere.\n",
            "Google went over its plans for Android 13, and the next version of its mobile OS seems to be going further with the ideas introduced in Android 12.\n",
            "The company is adding Material You themes to more places, letting you set apps to use different languages, and adding a few security and privacy features.\n",
            "That doesn't add up to an earth-shattering release, but as my colleague Jon Porter points out, that's probably a good thing.\n",
            "Android 12 has been a bit messy, so a year of refinements and small improvements is probably warranted.\n",
            "For those who want to try it out, the beta is available today.\n",
            "Google is bringing back its Wallet app as a place to hold not just your payment cards, but your passes, rewards program memberships, vaccination records, and more.\n",
            "Google says the app is built for the age of digital identity.\n",
            "While I realize that's probably the future, that knowledge doesn't make me miss my physical Google Wallet debit card any less.\n",
            "Google's adding a new mode to Maps, which is basically Street View from the sky — in select cities, you'll be able to get an overview of a location to get a better view of the geography before getting lost in the streets below.\n",

            "The sports talk personality is being elevated into a new role overseeing Spotify's global sports strategy, the company announced this morning.\n",
            "Outside of the talk space, Spotify inked a deal in March with FC Barcelona for branded shirts for the 2022–2023 season.\n",
            "Sports (soccer in particular) are big for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.\n",
            "He unsuccessfully tried to buy Arsenal FC last year.\n",
            "When talking about the new FC Barcelona deal with investors last month, he explained the rationale.\n",
            "“I know a lot of you are Americans, but let me just state sports is a massive thing globally,” he said.\n",
            "“And football or soccer is the number one sport in the world, and FC Barcelona is the number one team in the world.\n",
            "So we are talking about hundreds of millions of consumers.”\n",
            "As the company branches out into global sports coverage, more soccer content seems like a given.\n",

            "Cutler and McNamara will fill the hole left by Spotify's last head of studios, Courtney Holt, who stepped back in April after nearly five years with the company.\n",
            "During his time leading the division, Holt was credited with brokering exclusive deals with stars like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper, and the Obamas to bring top talent over to Spotify, playing a big role in transforming the company into podcasting's Goliath.\n",
            "While much of the talent he brought in remains at Spotify, the company shared it will let its deal with the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions expire in six months.\n",

            "While giving examples of new apps featured on Wear OS 3, Google took the time to call out KakaoTalk.\n",
            "I won't lie.\n",
            "I stood up, pointed my finger at my computer monitor, and screeched some version of “AHA!\n",
            "I was right!”\n",
            "If you already know what KakaoTalk is, you likely are Korean, Korean-American, have a ton of Korean friends, love K-pop and K-dramas, or have lived / are living in Korea.\n",
            "You can see where I'm going here.\n",
            "KakaoTalk is the number one messaging app in Korea.\n",
            "The easiest way I can describe it is that KakaoTalk is Korea's version of WeChat or WhatsApp.\n",
            "According to Statista, more than 47 million South Koreans were active monthly users on the app in Q4 2021.\n",
            "The current population of South Korea is roughly 51 million.\n",
            "In my family, only the iPhone users actually text each other.\n",
            "The rest of the time, it's KakaoTalk.\n",
            "That's where the family group chat is.\n",
            "It's how I call and text my aunt.\n",
            "If I call my aunt the “normal” way, she is much less likely to pick up than if I call her over KakaoTalk.\n",
            "When my parents were alive, it was the main app we used to communicate, send pictures, and share videos.\n",
            "I sometimes hear the KakaoTalk ringtone in my dreams.\n",
            "While Tizen, Samsung's proprietary wearable OS, had its strengths, it didn't have a good selection of third-party apps.\n",
            "What third-party apps it did have were infrequently updated.\n",
            "Meanwhile, Apple and less technologically impressive Wear OS watches had a much more robust app ecosystem.\n",
            "Fixing this weakness was the main reason Samsung made the switch to Wear OS.\n",
            "I doubt Samsung would ever admit it, but my theory is that Kakao's refusal to make a Tizen app drove home the point that Samsung would have to abandon the platform if it wanted to grow its smartwatch business.\n",
            "Samsung is the most powerful company in the country.\n",
            "It accounts for roughly 20 percent of South Korea's GDP — and it could not get KakaoTalk, the country's most popular messaging and social media app, to develop a dedicated Tizen app.\n",
            "Reportedly, the reason KakaoTalk gave boiled down to Tizen's market reach not being worth the effort.\n",
            "To rub salt in the wound, KakaoTalk had already created Android, iOS, and watchOS versions of its app.\n",
            "Samsung was, in essence, getting dissed on its home turf.\n",
            "KakaoTalk actually developed its Wear OS app back in October, but it's another thing for it to be singled out at I/O.\n",
            "This actually isn't the first time KakaoTalk has been featured in Wear OS promotional materials.\n",
            "The app was also thrown up on the screen at Google I/O last year when Google announced it was collaborating with Samsung on Wear OS 3.\n",
            "I have to imagine this was Google helping Samsung out in appealing to the Korean market, where 72 percent of the population uses Android and 67 percent uses Samsung phones.\n",
            "(Google did also use japchae during the keynote to demo “multisearch near me,” and you cannot underestimate Korean national pride at stuff like that.)\n",
            "This is Samsung signaling to the Asian market that it's got the apps they want now.\n",
            "Apps that have been on the Apple Watch for a long, long time.\n",
            "For instance, LINE, another Korean-made chat app that is hugely popular in Japan, was also included as one of the featured Wear OS 3 apps.\n",
            "And while Google may not decide to bring the Pixel Watch to the Asian market, these additions do help Samsung smartwatches appear more appealing in arguably its most important market — Asia.\n",

            "Despite using a similar design to prior models, the 2021 edition offers significantly improved performance thanks to its A12 Bionic processor.\n",
            "It also offers support for Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1, and it includes a better Siri Remote that's easier to use (and less fragile).\n",
            "While you can certainly buy more affordable streaming gadgets, like a Chromecast for Fire TV Stick, the Apple TV 4K offers the best overall streaming experience, especially if you're deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.\n",
            "It boasts a combination of great user experience, reliable performance, Dolby Vision and Atmos support, and add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus that you won't find in cheaper 4K streaming gadgets.\n",
            "We don't think the improved performance justifies upgrading if you already have the last-gen Apple TV, but if you've own something older or don't own a streaming device at all — like high-school grads leaving home for the first time — this could be a good deal to take advantage of.\n",

            "DJI's Mavic 3 is the best consumer drone for video and photography you can currently buy, offering excellent image quality and several impressive features.\n",
            "It's not only capable of shooting 4K video at up to 120fps like the Mavic 2 Pro but it also boasts a longer flight time of 46 minutes.\n",
            "It's also DJI's first drone that can transmit a 1080p / 60fps live feed to the included RC Pro Controller, meaning the camera view is displayed at specifications more similar to what is actually being recorded.\n",
            "While we were disappointed in its telephoto lens and its lack of some features — namely the ability to capture panorama photos and hyperlapse images — DJI's Mavic 3 remains a great choice for more experienced drone pilots.\n",

            "It also supports an 82-degree field of view and offers a useful fixed focus, which means you won't have to worry about the lens going in and out of focus while moving about.\n",
            "Plus, you have the option of using the webcam's companion software to customize how you look, which is handy for Zoom calls.\n",
            "Other things we liked about the webcam were the included privacy cap and the tripod thread on its bottom, something that allows creators and other users to easily mount it to a tripod.\n",

            "Today let's talk about the highest-profile conflict to date between Meta and its Oversight Board, an independent organization the company established to help it navigate the most difficult questions related to policy and content moderation.\n",
            "Since before the board was created, it has faced criticism that it primarily serves a public-relations function for the company formerly known as Facebook.\n",
            "The board relies on funding from Meta, it has a contractual relationship with it governing its use of user data, and its founding members were hand-picked by the company.\n",
            "Aiding in the perception that it's mostly a PR project is the fact that to date, Meta and the board have rarely been in conflict.\n",
            "In the first quarter of its existence, of 18 recommendations the board made to Meta, the company implemented 14.\n",
            "And even though it often rules against Facebook's content moderators, ordering removed posts to be restored, none of those reversals has generate any significant controversy.\n",
            "(Also, from Facebook's perspective, the more the board reverses it, the more credible it is, and thus the more blame it can shoulder for any unpopular calls.)\n",
            "That's what made this week's statements, published by both sides, so noteworthy.\n",
            "After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Meta had asked the board to issue an advisory opinion on how it should moderate content during wartime.\n",
            "The conflict had raised a series of difficult questions, including under what circumstances users can post photos of dead bodies or videos of prisoners of war criticizing the conflict.\n",
            "And in the most prominent content moderation question of the invasion to date, Meta decided to temporarily permit calls for violence against Russian soldiers, Vladimir Putin, and others.\n",
            "All of which raised important questions about the balance between free expression and user safety.\n",
            "But after asking the board to weigh in, Meta changed its mind — and asked board members to say nothing at all.\n",
            "From the company's blog post:\n",
            "Late last month, Meta withdrew a policy advisory opinion (PAO) request related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that had previously been referred to the Oversight Board.\n",
            "This decision was not made lightly — the PAO was withdrawn due to ongoing safety and security concerns.\n",
            "While the PAO has been withdrawn, we stand by our efforts related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and believe we are taking the right steps to protect speech and balance the ongoing security concerns on the ground.\n",
            "In response, the board said in a statement that it is “disappointed” by the move:\n",
            "While the Board understands these concerns, we believe the request raises important issues and are disappointed by the company's decision to withdraw it.\n",
            "The Board also notes the withdrawal of this request does not diminish Meta's responsibility to carefully consider the ongoing content moderation issues which have arisen from this war, which the Board continues to follow.\n",
            "Indeed, the importance for the company to defend freedom of expression and human rights has only increased.\n",
            "Both statements were extremely vague, so I spent a day talking with people familiar with the matter who could fill me in on what happened.\n",
            "Here's what I've learned.\n",
            "One of the most disturbing trends of the past year has been the way that authoritarian governments in general, and Russia in particular, have used the intimidation of employees on the ground to force platforms to do their bidding.\n",
            "Last fall, Apple and Google both removed from their respective stores an app that enabled anti-Putin forces to organize before an election.\n",
            "In the aftermath, we learned that Russian agents had threatened their employees, in person, with jail time or worse.\n",
            "Life for those employees — and their families — has only become more difficult since Putin's invasion.\n",
            "The country passed draconian laws outlawing truthful discussion of the war, and the combination of those laws and sanctions from the United States and Europe has forced many platforms to withdraw services from Russia entirely.\n",
            "In the wake of Meta's decision to allow calls for violence against the invaders, Russia said that Meta had engaged in “extremist” activities.\n",
            "That potentially put hundreds of Meta employees at risk of being jailed.\n",

            "The best feature of the new Yeedi is its oscillating mopping action, meaning it scrubs your floors rather than just wiping them.\n",
            "Also, the water reservoir only holds 180mL, so you need to refill it on every run.\n",
            "While the Yeedi can now auto-avoid carpeted areas when mopping and increase suction as it goes over rugs in vacuum-only mode, this is a standard feature on a lot of mopping vacs today.\n",
            "You also have to remove the mopping tank if you want to vacuum your carpets as it can't vacuum them with its mop on.\n",

            "The Yeedi did a good job of cleaning my house in neat, methodical rows, carefully navigating around objects without banging into things, and covering most of my floor.\n",
            "Although it did occasionally skip large areas for no obvious reason.\n",
            "This is probably due to its navigation and mapping tech.\n",
            "Most high-end robot vacuums use lidar-based SLAM mapping, deploying a more precise laser tech to determine where your rooms are.\n",
            "Yeedi uses a camera on top of the robot for navigation, which is a cheaper technology and much less precise.\n",
            "This visual SLAM mapping failed to properly identify the rooms in my house, struggling to see the wider doorways.\n",
            "The robot could only find two rooms in my five-room, 800-square-foot downstairs area, and that was after two tries.\n",
            "After its first mapping run, it was convinced I lived in one giant room.\n",
            "But even without specific rooms, I could create digital keep-out zones, areas I don't want the robot to go to, which are another basic necessity on any decent robot vacuum these days.\n",
            "You can only have one map at the moment, but Yeedi says multi-floor mapping is coming.\n",
            "Yeedi did recently push a software update that added the ability to divide and merge rooms on the map, so I was able to manually create rooms and use the room-specific cleaning features.\n",
            "However, its navigation smarts failed it a few times, with the robot missing an entire room a couple of times and ending the cleaning job before it had reached everywhere.\n",
            "Obstacle avoidance is also less effective compared to more expensive competitors deploying AI-powered avoidance tech.\n",
            "The robot uses 3D structured light technology to detect items that are over an inch tall, so floor mats, cables, pencils, and your kitty's little accident won't be avoided.\n",
            "It does do well at avoiding bigger items, such as a pair of shoes or a school backpack left in the hall, but pencils, headphones, cables, and socks all tripped it up.\n",
            "The Yeedi is good at navigating around things, maneuvering through chair legs and over thick rug tassels with no trouble.\n",
            "In fact, it's one of the only bot vacs I've tested that figured its way out of my lounge chair trap (skinny flat lounger feet next to an ottoman with skinny flat feet).\n",
            "I could hear its motor getting louder and quieter as it navigated its way around the problem like it was thinking really hard, finally freeing itself after a few minutes.\n",
            "All this means while you don't have to tidy up as much if you want to make sure the robot finishes its run, you can't be totally carefree about it all.\n",

            "You just pull out the self-sealing bag and dispose of it easily without getting dust everywhere.\n",
            "The Yeedi's auto-empty station worked fine in testing, it didn't get clogged and effectively emptied the 420mL bin onboard the bot on most attempts (I had to help it out once because the bin was really full).\n",
            "Be warned, it is a very loud process that goes on for about 20 seconds.\n",
            "Unlike a couple of higher-end mop / vac robots, the Yeedi auto-empty station is for dust only; it can't empty or refill the mop reservoir.\n",
            "You'll need to do that yourself before and after every mopping session.\n",
            "Yeedi's app has seen a lot of improvements since I first tested it a couple of years ago when it was rather flaky.\n",
            "But it still has its moments including slow loading and poor grammar in some areas.\n",
            "But the main features you want are there — room-specific cleaning (if it can find your rooms), clean zones, and the option to set a cleaning sequence (go to the kitchen first, then the living room, then the dining room, and so on), set schedules for the robot, and adjust the cleaning levels.\n",
            "There are four vacuum suction levels — and the robot is super quiet on the lowest setting — plus three water-flow levels for the mop (I always use the highest setting for the best clean).\n",
            "You can turn on continuous cleaning so that it will go back to its base and recharge if it needs to finish a job; plus, there's a handy Do Not Disturb setting.\n",

            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",

            "It also intelligently avoids mopping your carpets and has 3D obstacle avoidance, so it can get through the job without being derailed by a pair of shoes.\n",
            "While the Yeedi is a good robot with some high-end features for a lower price, it's not cheap enough or smart enough to really disrupt the big boys.\n",
            "It does a simple job well.\n",
            "There's no obstacle avoidance or room-specific cleaning, but it has a huge bin, and it really sucks up the dirt as it bumps and rolls around your house.\n",
            "By jumping up into the robot vacuum arena where smart mapping, obstacle avoidance, and oscillating mopping are playing, the Yeedi Vac 2 Pro is punching above its weight, and while it holds its own on the hardware front, the mapping/software experience is lackluster.\n",
            "The best feature of the new Yeedi is its oscillating mopping action, meaning it scrubs your floors rather than just wiping them.\n",
            "Also, the water reservoir only holds 180mL, so you need to refill it on every run.\n",
            "While the Yeedi can now auto-avoid carpeted areas when mopping and increase suction as it goes over rugs in vacuum-only mode, this is a standard feature on a lot of mopping vacs today.\n",
            "You also have to remove the mopping tank if you want to vacuum your carpets as it can't vacuum them with its mop on.\n",
            "It's not a big chore but does mean you are less likely to use the mopping feature regularly if you have a lot of rugs or carpets you also want to keep clean.\n",
            "Higher-end options like the Roborock S7 have found a way to address this, by lifting the mop when going over carpet.\n",
            "The Roborock also uses this feature to air dry the mop while charging, with the Yeedi you have to remove it after every mopping run.\n",
            "The Yeedi vacuum has an impressive 3000Pa of suction power and a big 5,200mAh battery that promises over three hours runtime, easily on par with most top-of-the-line models.\n",
            "But it never ran for more than 85 minutes in testing and often returned with a low battery.\n",
            "The Yeedi did a good job of cleaning my house in neat, methodical rows, carefully navigating around objects without banging into things, and covering most of my floor.\n",
            "Although it did occasionally skip large areas for no obvious reason.\n",
            "This is probably due to its navigation and mapping tech.\n",
            "Most high-end robot vacuums use lidar-based SLAM mapping, deploying a more precise laser tech to determine where your rooms are.\n",
            "Yeedi uses a camera on top of the robot for navigation, which is a cheaper technology and much less precise.\n",
            "This visual SLAM mapping failed to properly identify the rooms in my house, struggling to see the wider doorways.\n",
            "The robot could only find two rooms in my five-room, 800-square-foot downstairs area, and that was after two tries.\n",
            "After its first mapping run, it was convinced I lived in one giant room.\n",
            "But even without specific rooms, I could create digital keep-out zones, areas I don't want the robot to go to, which are another basic necessity on any decent robot vacuum these days.\n",
            "You can only have one map at the moment, but Yeedi says multi-floor mapping is coming.\n",
            "Yeedi did recently push a software update that added the ability to divide and merge rooms on the map, so I was able to manually create rooms and use the room-specific cleaning features.\n",
            "However, its navigation smarts failed it a few times, with the robot missing an entire room a couple of times and ending the cleaning job before it had reached everywhere.\n",
            "Obstacle avoidance is also less effective compared to more expensive competitors deploying AI-powered avoidance tech.\n",
            "The robot uses 3D structured light technology to detect items that are over an inch tall, so floor mats, cables, pencils, and your kitty's little accident won't be avoided.\n",
            "It does do well at avoiding bigger items, such as a pair of shoes or a school backpack left in the hall, but pencils, headphones, cables, and socks all tripped it up.\n",
            "The Yeedi is good at navigating around things, maneuvering through chair legs and over thick rug tassels with no trouble.\n",
            "In fact, it's one of the only bot vacs I've tested that figured its way out of my lounge chair trap (skinny flat lounger feet next to an ottoman with skinny flat feet).\n",
            "I could hear its motor getting louder and quieter as it navigated its way around the problem like it was thinking really hard, finally freeing itself after a few minutes.\n",
            "All this means while you don't have to tidy up as much if you want to make sure the robot finishes its run, you can't be totally carefree about it all.\n",
            "Bringing connected devices into your home also brings with it concerns about how the data they collect is protected.\n",

            "Yeedi's privacy policy states that its robot “collects information regarding how and when the product is used.\n",
            "Its operation log information as well as data regarding the cleaning environment, such as a cleaning map.\n",
            "… This data can allow us to quickly spot problems and develop better functions and services.” Yeedi says it follows all local regulations around data protection and keeps all data “highly confidential” but did not provide details around how data is stored or protected.\n",
            "The Yeedi Vac 2 Pro works with Yeedi's self-empty station for emptying the bin, an add-on I highly recommend for anyone considering a robot vacuum.\n",
            "You just pull out the self-sealing bag and dispose of it easily without getting dust everywhere.\n",
            "The Yeedi's auto-empty station worked fine in testing, it didn't get clogged and effectively emptied the 420mL bin onboard the bot on most attempts (I had to help it out once because the bin was really full).\n",
            "Be warned, it is a very loud process that goes on for about 20 seconds.\n",
            "Unlike a couple of higher-end mop / vac robots, the Yeedi auto-empty station is for dust only; it can't empty or refill the mop reservoir.\n",
            "You'll need to do that yourself before and after every mopping session.\n",
            "Yeedi's app has seen a lot of improvements since I first tested it a couple of years ago when it was rather flaky.\n",
            "But it still has its moments including slow loading and poor grammar in some areas.\n",
            "But the main features you want are there — room-specific cleaning (if it can find your rooms), clean zones, and the option to set a cleaning sequence (go to the kitchen first, then the living room, then the dining room, and so on), set schedules for the robot, and adjust the cleaning levels.\n",
            "There are four vacuum suction levels — and the robot is super quiet on the lowest setting — plus three water-flow levels for the mop (I always use the highest setting for the best clean).\n",
            "You can turn on continuous cleaning so that it will go back to its base and recharge if it needs to finish a job; plus, there's a handy Do Not Disturb setting.\n",
            "The Yeedi Vac 2 Pro ticks all the right boxes — but some of its features, such as mapping, just aren't as well-executed as those on the Roborocks and iRobots of this space.\n",
            "If you do step up to the Roborock (which has sonic mopping, lidar mapping, and standard obstacle avoidance), your robot can vacuum and mop your floors and vacuum your carpets, all in one go.\n",
            "Ecovacs has several remarkably similar options at various price points, but, as I noted in my review of its flagship robot vacuum, its mapping also suffers from accuracy issues.\n",

            "The story of this year's Google I/O actually started three years ago.\n",
            "At I/O 2019, onstage at the Shoreline Auditorium in Mountain View, California, Rick Osterloh, Google's SVP of devices and services, laid out a new vision for the future of computing.\n",
            "“In the mobile era, smartphones changed the world,” he said.\n",
            "“It's super useful to have a powerful computer wherever you are.” But he described an even more ambitious world beyond that, where your computer wasn't a thing in your pocket at all.\n",
            "It was all around you.\n",
            "It was everything.\n",
            "“Your devices work together with services and AI, so help is anywhere you want it, and it's fluid.\n",
            "The technology just fades into the background when you don't need it.\n",
            "So the devices aren't the center of the system — you are.” He called the idea “ambient computing,” nodding to a concept that has floated around Amazon, Apple, and other companies over the last few years.\n",
            "One easy way to interpret ambient computing is around voice assistants and robots.\n",
            "Put Google Assistant in everything, yell at your appliances, done and done.\n",
            "But that's only the very beginning of the idea.\n",
            "The ambient computer Google imagines is more like a guardian angel or a super-sentient Star Wars robot.\n",
            "It's an engine that understands you completely and follows you around, churning through and solving for all the stuff in your life.\n",
            "The small (when's my next appointment?)\n",
            "and the big (help me plan my wedding) and the mundane (turn the lights off) and the life-changing (am I having a heart attack?).\n",
            "The wheres and whens and hows don't matter, only the whats and whys.\n",
            "The ambient computer isn't a gadget — it's almost a being; it's the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts whole that comes out of a million perfectly-connected things.\n",
            "Which is a problem for Google.\n",
            "The company is famously decentralized and non-hierarchical, and it can sometimes seem like every single engineer on staff is given the green light to ship whatever they made that week.\n",
            "And so, since that day in 2019, Google has mostly continued to do what Google always does, which is build an unbelievable amount of stuff, often without any discernible strategy or plan behind it.\n",
            "It's not that Google didn't have a bigger vision; it's just that no one seemed to be interested in doing the connective work required for the all-encompassing, perfectly-connected future Osterloh had imagined.\n",
            "Google was becoming a warehouse full of cool stuff rather than an ecosystem.\n",
            "But over the last couple of years, Google has begun to change in order to meet this challenge.\n",
            "Osterloh's devices team, for instance, has completely reset its relationship with the Android team.\n",
            "For a long time, the company proudly maintained a wall between Pixel and Android, treating its internal hardware team like any other manufacturer.\n",
            "Now, Google treats Pixel like the tip of the spear: it's meant to be both a flagship device and a development platform through which Google can build features it then shares with the rest of the ecosystem.\n",
            "“We really sort of co-design where things are headed,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“I think that's just sort of the nature of how computers have changed, and computing models have changed.” Both teams share visions of an ambient future, he said.\n",
            "“And we're working on it together.”\n",
            "Around the company, these related teams and products are starting to come closer together.\n",
            "They're building on unified tech, like Google's custom Tensor processors, and on common concepts like conversational AI.\n",
            "As a result, Google I/O feels unusually… coherent this year.\n",
            "Google is trying — harder than I can remember — to build products that not only work well but work well together.\n",
            "Search is becoming a multisensory, multi-device proposition that understands both who's searching and what they're really looking for.\n",
            "It's also extending the search experience far beyond just questions and answers.\n",
            "It's making Android more context- and content-aware so that your phone changes to match the things you do on it.\n",
            "It's emphasizing natural interactions so that you can get information without memorizing a rigid set of commands.\n",
            "It's building the hardware ecosystem it needs to make all that work everywhere and the software to match.\n",
            "Now, let's be very clear: Google's work is only just beginning.\n",
            "It has to win market share in device categories it has failed for years to capture.\n",
            "It has to build new experiences inside new and old devices.\n",
            "It has to figure out how to solve Android fragmentation between its devices and the market-leading devices from companies like Samsung, which might be the hardest part of all.\n",
            "And it has to become more present in users' lives and extract more information from them, all without upsetting regulators, screwing up the search-ads business, or violating users' privacy.\n",
            "The ambient computer was never going to come easily, and Google has made its own efforts harder in countless ways over the years.\n",
            "But at the very least, the company seems to finally understand what an ambient computer requires — and why “it has Assistant!” is not a sufficient answer — and is beginning the work to get it done.\n",
            "When I sat down with Osterloh over a video call a few days before I/O, he began to wax poetic about Google's hardware division, every so often glancing down just out of frame.\n",
            "I asked what he was looking at, suddenly suspicious it was a bunch of unreleased devices.\n",
            "I was right.\n",
            "“This is Pixel 6,” he said, holding up his current device.\n",
            "“And then, I have a Pixel 6A, in a very disguised case,” this time holding up a black brick of rubber surrounding the unreleased device.\n",
            "“And I have a Pixel 7, also in disguise.” He held up his wrist, too, with a Pixel Watch strapped to it.\n",
            "As we talked, Osterloh reiterated the usual Google pitch for ambient computing, but this time, it came with a bit of a twist to the familiar.\n",
            "The long-term vision is still an always-there version of Google that works everywhere with everything all the time, but right now?\n",
            "Right now, it's still all about the ultra-fast processor in your pocket.\n",
            "“Certainly for the foreseeable future, we feel like the most crucial part of that is the pocketable computer, the mobile phone,” he said.\n",
            "The smartphone is the center of the computing universe for billions of users around the globe, and so the first version of Osterloh's ambient computer will be built around a smartphone, too.\n",
            "“The target of what Pixel is, is about having an awesome user experience that keeps getting better over time,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“And with that as the core, what you realize is like the thing that is essential to have across these devices is Tensor.”\n",
            "The Google-designed Tensor processor was the key feature introduced alongside the Pixel 6, largely as a way to improve its on-device AI capabilities for speech recognition and more.\n",
            "And now, it seems, it's going to be a staple of the line: Osterloh said all the upcoming Pixel phones — and even the Android-powered tablet the team is working on for release next year — will run on its Tensor processor.\n",
            "The smartphone is the center of the universe for now, but you can already start to see how that might change.\n",
            "The new Pixel Buds Pro are a powerful set of noise-canceling headphones, for instance, but also a hands-free interface into a wirelessly connected computing device.\n",
            "“Devices that can be close to your ear and enable you to have real-time communication with the computer are an absolutely essential part of ambient computing,” Osterloh said, noting that he now does most of his emailing via voice.\n",
            "Similarly, the new Pixel Watch is, in some ways, a phone accessory, delivering notifications and the like to your wrist and offering another interface to the same power in your pocket.\n",
            "But Google's also selling an LTE version, so you'll be able to access Assistant or pay with Google Wallet without needing your phone nearby.\n",
            "And that tablet, whenever it comes, will have all the same Pixel capabilities in a bigger shell.\n",
            "The point is that it doesn't matter, in the long run, which device you use.\n",
            "“Where the computing capability is, and how powerful the devices themselves are, shouldn't matter to the user,” Osterloh said.\n",
            "“I think what they should see is increasing capabilities.”\n",
            "The Pixel and Android teams have recently adopted a sort of mantra: Better Together.\n",
            "Much of what's new this year in Android 13 is not whizbang new features but small tweaks meant to make the ecosystem a little more seamless.\n",
            "Through an update to the Chrome OS Phone Hub feature, you'll be able to use all your messaging apps on your Chromebook just as you would on your phone.\n",
            "Support for the Matter smart home standard now comes built into Android, which should make setting up and controlling new devices much easier.\n",
            "Google's extending support for its Cast protocols for sending audio and video to other devices and improving its Fast Pair services to make it easy to connect Bluetooth devices.\n",
            "It has been talking about these features since CES in January and has signed up an impressive list of partners.\n",
            "It sounds a bit like Google finally watched an Apple ad and discovered that making hardware and software together really does help.\n",
            "Who knew!\n",
            "But Google's position is genuinely tricky here.\n",
            "Google's ad business relies on a mind-bendingly huge scale, which it gets mostly thanks to other companies building Android products.\n",
            "That means Google has to keep all those partners happy and feeling like they're on a level playing field with the Pixel team.\n",
            "And it simply can't control its ecosystem like Apple can.\n",
            "It is forever worrying about backward compatibility and how things will work on devices of all sizes, prices, and power.\n",
            "It has to engender support to make big changes, whereas Apple just brute-forces the future.\n",
            "But Google has become increasingly bold in pushing ahead with the Pixel brand.\n",
            "It can afford to because Pixel is hardly a real sales threat to Samsung and others.\n",
            "(Besides, where are Android manufacturers going to go?\n",
            "Windows Mobile?)\n",
            "But it also has to because Google only wins if the ecosystem buys in, and Pixel is Google's best chance to model what the entire Android ecosystem should look like.\n",
            "That's what Osterloh sees as his job and, in large part, his team's reason for being.\n",
            "If Pixel's never going to be a smash-hit bestseller (and it looks like it won't be), the only way Google can win in the long run is to use it as a way to pressure Samsung and others to keep up Google's features and ideas.\n",
            "Google has a chance to lead even more in tablets and smartwatches, two Android markets in desperate need of a path forward.\n",
            "“Phone is certainly super important,” said Sameer Samat, a VP of product management on the Android team.\n",
            "“But it's also becoming very clear that there are other device form factors which are complementary and also critical to a consumer deciding which ecosystem to buy into, and which ecosystem to live.”\n",
            "That's another way of saying the only way Google can get to its ambient computing dreams is to make sure Google is everywhere.\n",
            "Like, literally everywhere.\n",
            "That's why Google continues to invest in products in seemingly every square inch of your life, from your TV to your thermostat to your car to your wrist to your ears.\n",
            "The ambient-computing future may be one computer to rule them all, but that computer needs a near-infinite set of user interfaces.\n",
            "The second step to making ambient computing work is to make it really, really easy to use.\n",
            "Google is relentlessly trying to whittle away every bit of friction involved in accessing its services, particularly the Assistant.\n",
            "For instance, if you own a Nest Hub Max, you'll soon be able to talk to it just by looking into its camera, and you'll be able to set timers or turn off the lights without issuing a command at all.\n",
            "“It's kind of like you and I having a conversation,” said Nino Tasca, a director of product management on Google's speech team.\n",
            "“Sometimes, I'll use your name to start a conversation.\n",
            "But if I'm already staring at you and ask you directly, you know I'm talking to you.” Google is obsessed with making everything natural and conversational because it's convinced that making it easy is actually more important than making it fast.\n",
            "The same logic applies to search, which is quickly becoming a multi-sensory, multi-modal thing.\n",
            "“The way you search for information shouldn't be constrained to typing keywords into a search box,” said Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's SVP for knowledge and information products.\n",
            "“Our vision is to make the whole world around you searchable, so you can find helpful information about whatever you see, hear and experience, in whichever ways are most natural to you.”\n",
            "That has forced Google to reinvent both the input of search, leaning on voice and images just as much as the text box, as well as the output.\n",
            "“Some people really find it easy to process video,” said Liz Reid, a VP of engineering on the search team, “and other people will find it distracting.\n",
            "On the other hand, some people's literacy is not as good, and so a long web page that you have to read through not only takes time, but they're gonna get lost, and a video that's spoken in their language is really intuitive.” Google built one hell of a text box, but it's not enough anymore.\n",
            "The most obvious outpouring of that work is multisearch.\n",
            "Using the Google app, you can take a photo of a dress — in Google's examples, it's always a dress — and then type “green” to search for that dress but in green.\n",
            "That's the kind of thing you just couldn't do in a text box.\n",
            "And at I/O, Google also showed off a tool for running multisearch on an image with multiple things in it: take a picture of the peanut butter aisle, type “nut-free,” and Google will tell you which one to buy.\n",
            "“We find when we unlock new capabilities that people had information needs that were just too hard to express,” Reid said.\n",
            "“And then they start expressing them on there.” Search used to be one thing, Lens was another, voice was a third, but when you combine them, new things become possible.\n",
            "But the real challenge for Google is that it's much more than a question-and-answer engine now.\n",
            "“What's best isn't really, in many of these cases, a strict stack rank, right?” Reid said.\n",
            "“A lot of these newer use cases, there's a style or a taste component.” Shopping has become important to Google, for instance, but there's no single correct answer for “best t-shirt.” Plus, Google is using search more and more as a way to keep you inside Google's ecosystem; the search box is increasingly just a launcher to various Google things.\n",
            "So rather than just aiming to understand the internet, Google has to learn to understand its users better than ever.\n",

            "In terms of energy capacity, I found that I was getting around 2.3 miles per kilowatt-hour of battery usage on surface roads and highways.\n",

            "(More on that later.)\n",
            "But ultimately, I found the range and energy usage to be adequate for most driving scenarios.\n",
            "For most EV-curious consumers, range anxiety is giving way to charging anxiety.\n",
            "Ford didn't provide us with any opportunities to charge the F-150 Lightning, so I can't speak to the time it takes to repower the battery.\n",
            "Charging is still a sore spot for most EVs.\n",
            "The truth is, unless Ford invests in building out its own dedicated network (which it's not), there's only so much the company can do to make the public charging experience better.\n",
            "Ford's band-aid solution is that it has coalesced a handful of disparate independent public charging networks into what it calls the FordPass Charging Network.\n",
            "All of these chargers show up in the FordPass smartphone app as if they are one large network, and Ford is even working with some so that owners don't need to create new accounts or download other apps to start charging.\n",
            "It's a great idea in theory, but it needs more work.\n",
            "At home, a 120-volt outlet will trickle 3 miles per hour into the battery, while a 240-volt outlet can add around 14 miles per hour.\n",
            "The real standout charging feature is exclusive to the extended range versions: Ford is selling a new 80-amp home charging station that not only fully charges the F-150 Lightning in eight hours but allows owners to easily power their entire home for around three days — or even up to 10 days with minimal usage — in the event of a power outage.\n",
            "The ability to draw power from the battery pack isn't limited to these extreme scenarios, though.\n",
            "All of the base trims of the F-150 Lightning can put out 2.4kW of onboard power, and the more expensive Lariat and Platinum trims offer a total of 9.6kW of onboard power.\n",
            "The more expensive F-150 Lightnings also have 11 built-in power sockets — seven in the cab and bed, including a 240V outlet, and four in the front trunk — plus a handful of USB ports.\n",
            "Ford began playing with this idea of turning a vehicle into a mobile generator of sorts with the F-150 hybrid, but the higher trims of the F-150 Lightning will offer even more onboard power, and they won't use gas to generate it.\n",
            "That's not only a great feature for anyone who needs power on the go, but it could be a huge benefit for fleet operators or small businesses looking to go green.\n",
            "On my first day driving the F-150 Lightning, I got to experience Ford's hands-free driver assistance system, BlueCruise.\n",
            "This feature comes standard of the Platinum trim level and will cost extra to upgrade for Lariat trims.\n",
            "I was excited to test out this feature because this was Ford's long-awaited answer to General Motors' Super Cruise, which is considered the gold standard for Level 2 advanced driver assist systems.\n",
            "(Tesla's Autopilot does not allow for hands-free driving, though its Full Self-Driving beta system does.)\n",
            "These systems work in concert with a number of distinct features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection, pedestrian monitoring, and stop sign detection.\n",
            "On certain divided highways (Ford says it works on “over 100,000 miles”), F-150 Lightning drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals, while infrared sensors mounted in the dash monitor their eyes to ensure they stay focused on the road ahead.\n",
            "As soon as you enter an approved area, a notification appears on the gauge cluster informing you that BlueCruise is available.\n",
            "I found the system very easy to engage and disengage, which wasn't always the case with other Level 2 systems.\n",
            "After you get over the initial urge to slam on the brakes every time a car merges into your lane, you eventually get to sit back and enjoy the convenience of the system.\n",
            "Like other automakers, Ford markets BlueCruise as an active safety feature, but I see them more as convenience features designed to take some of the stress out of long highway trips and stop-and-go traffic.\n",
            "I used BlueCruise for about an hour of driving, and I only had to disengage it twice: once when the system seemed to be steering toward a row of yellow barrels that mark the barrier between the highway and the off-ramp and another time when another vehicle merged dangerously in front of me.\n",
            "Otherwise, it worked like a charm.\n",
            "Inside the F-150 Lightning will be a familiar world to many truck owners — with a few caveats.\n",
            "F-150 owners will recognize delightful features such as the gear shift that folds down to allow for an expanded workstation in the center console, with enough space for a laptop, a pad of paper, or even your lunch.\n",
            "For people who spend a lot of time in their trucks — while charging, perhaps — the two front seats can fold back pretty much totally flat.\n",
            "I didn't attempt a nap, but I was tempted.\n",
            "The center stack touchscreen — standard 12-inch landscape or optional 15.5-inch portrait style — is the heart of the interior.\n",
            "The portrait-style touchscreen is similar to what's found in the Mustang Mach-E and will likely become an optional feature for all F-series trucks in the near future.\n",
            "The screen runs Ford's Sync 4A, which is the latest version of the automaker's infotainment system that debuted in the Mustang Mach-E.\n",
            "It pretty much operates in a two-pane layout, with the top two-thirds dedicated to navigation or media controls and the bottom third for climate and other vehicle functions.\n",
            "It also features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto if you'd rather just work with the apps on your phone.\n",
            "That said, Sync 4A works pretty seamlessly, with minimal lag when switching between menus.\n",
            "There are four drive modes: normal, sport, tow/haul, and off-road.\n",
            "On surface roads, I stuck to normal, occasionally switching to sport when it seemed fit.\n",
            "The graphic display in the instrument cluster let me know how much power I was sending back to the battery through regenerative braking, which was useful information to see.\n",
            "The F-150 Lightning does not feature a heads-up display, though Ford's engineers hinted that it could be coming to future models.\n",
            "So I'll just come right out and say it: I suck at driving large vehicles.\n",
            "And when those large vehicles are attached to other equally large vehicles, my skills are questionable at best.\n",
            "While towing a 24-foot-long speedboat out of a winery parking lot, I practically obliterated a metal-and-plastic sign standing outside the entrance.\n",
            "I'm fine admitting this.\n",
            "It's good to know your limitations.\n",
            "I took some comfort from the security guard who told me I wasn't the only one to do this.\n",
            "Perhaps I was paying too close attention to the wealth of information provided on the gauge cluster to notice the sign being crushed under the wheels of the boat behind me.\n",
            "Ford went the extra mile in taking a lot of the guesswork out of towing, enabling owners to create a profile based on the object being towed.\n",
            "In the case of the 8,000-pound boat, I could see that the added weight would shave almost 100 miles off my range, from 250 miles on a full charge to 161.7 miles.\n",
            "The experience of driving the F-150 Lightning while towing a boat felt pretty choppy.\n",
            "(Pun intended!)\n",
            "I could feel the weight tugging on the steering wheel while accelerating along a windy road.\n",
            "In other words, it wasn't effortless, nor should it be.\n",
            "It's important for drivers to be aware of the weight that they're towing.\n",
            "On the other hand, hauling less than a thousand pounds of plywood was pretty effortless.\n",
            "After about 15 minutes, I almost forgot the wood was strapped down in the bed of the truck.\n",
            "Ford says the standard range versions of the Pro, XLT, and Lariat trims can tow a maximum of 7,700 pounds, while the extended range versions can take up to 10,000 pounds.\n",
            "The payload is rated for either 1,850 pounds or 2,235 pounds, depending on the trim level.\n",
            "Another confession: off-roading in the F-150 Lightning was very, very fun.\n",
            "I drove over large, beach ball-sized rocks, down extremely steep loose-gravel roads, and through several deep puddles.\n",
            "The truck dispatched each challenge with relative ease.\n",
            "(Shout out to Ford's spotters who made sure I didn't drive off a cliff.)\n",
            "The course included two large holes into which I was directed to steer the truck's front and rear driver-side tires.\n",
            "I was now stuck — or so I thought.\n",
            "Switching on the F-150 Lightning's electronic-locking rear differential, which is housed in the rear axle and, when activated, allows both wheels on a specific axle to turn at the same speed, did the trick.\n",
            "I even attempted it without the rear differential activated, and while it took a little more effort, it still made it out.\n",
            "Old F-150's featured ELD as a physical knob; in the Lightning, it's located in a submenu of the touchscreen.\n",
            "Naturally, off-roading is more energy-intensive than normal driving.\n",
            "Ford accounts for this with its off-road driving mode, which offers real-time range estimates and independent front and rear suspension.\n",
            "The software factors in not just weather and traffic conditions, but it also uses an onboard scale to measure the weight of any payload or towing weight.\n",
            "Based on my limited time with it, the F-150 Lightning is a great truck.\n",
            "It handles well, features a lot of cool tech, and will exceed the expectations of anyone who likes towing, hauling, or off-roading.\n",
            "(Ford insists this includes 80 percent of its customers.)\n",
            "Unfortunately, most people won't get to experience the F-150 Lightning's unique charms — at least, not this year.\n",
            "The number of electric F-150s Ford planned on making in its first few years of production has been a bit of a shifting target.\n",
            "At first, the company was only targeting 40,000 vehicles annually, eventually telling suppliers it expected that capacity to rise to 80,000 by early 2023.\n",
            "Now, that number has risen to 150,000 trucks by mid-2023 — though it's unclear how many will reach customers this year.\n",

            "Obviously those range numbers drop when you load up the truck bed with cargo or attach something heavy to the hitch.\n",
            "(More on that later.)\n",
            "But ultimately, I found the range and energy usage to be adequate for most driving scenarios.\n",
            "For most EV-curious consumers, range anxiety is giving way to charging anxiety.\n",
            "Ford didn't provide us with any opportunities to charge the F-150 Lightning, so I can't speak to the time it takes to repower the battery.\n",
            "Charging is still a sore spot for most EVs.\n",
            "The truth is, unless Ford invests in building out its own dedicated network (which it's not), there's only so much the company can do to make the public charging experience better.\n",
            "Ford's band-aid solution is that it has coalesced a handful of disparate independent public charging networks into what it calls the FordPass Charging Network.\n",
            "All of these chargers show up in the FordPass smartphone app as if they are one large network, and Ford is even working with some so that owners don't need to create new accounts or download other apps to start charging.\n",
            "It's a great idea in theory, but it needs more work.\n",
            "At home, a 120-volt outlet will trickle 3 miles per hour into the battery, while a 240-volt outlet can add around 14 miles per hour.\n",
            "The real standout charging feature is exclusive to the extended range versions: Ford is selling a new 80-amp home charging station that not only fully charges the F-150 Lightning in eight hours but allows owners to easily power their entire home for around three days — or even up to 10 days with minimal usage — in the event of a power outage.\n",
            "The ability to draw power from the battery pack isn't limited to these extreme scenarios, though.\n",
            "All of the base trims of the F-150 Lightning can put out 2.4kW of onboard power, and the more expensive Lariat and Platinum trims offer a total of 9.6kW of onboard power.\n",
            "The more expensive F-150 Lightnings also have 11 built-in power sockets — seven in the cab and bed, including a 240V outlet, and four in the front trunk — plus a handful of USB ports.\n",
            "Ford began playing with this idea of turning a vehicle into a mobile generator of sorts with the F-150 hybrid, but the higher trims of the F-150 Lightning will offer even more onboard power, and they won't use gas to generate it.\n",
            "That's not only a great feature for anyone who needs power on the go, but it could be a huge benefit for fleet operators or small businesses looking to go green.\n",
            "On my first day driving the F-150 Lightning, I got to experience Ford's hands-free driver assistance system, BlueCruise.\n",
            "This feature comes standard of the Platinum trim level and will cost extra to upgrade for Lariat trims.\n",
            "I was excited to test out this feature because this was Ford's long-awaited answer to General Motors' Super Cruise, which is considered the gold standard for Level 2 advanced driver assist systems.\n",
            "(Tesla's Autopilot does not allow for hands-free driving, though its Full Self-Driving beta system does.)\n",
            "These systems work in concert with a number of distinct features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection, pedestrian monitoring, and stop sign detection.\n",
            "On certain divided highways (Ford says it works on “over 100,000 miles”), F-150 Lightning drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals, while infrared sensors mounted in the dash monitor their eyes to ensure they stay focused on the road ahead.\n",
            "As soon as you enter an approved area, a notification appears on the gauge cluster informing you that BlueCruise is available.\n",
            "I found the system very easy to engage and disengage, which wasn't always the case with other Level 2 systems.\n",
            "After you get over the initial urge to slam on the brakes every time a car merges into your lane, you eventually get to sit back and enjoy the convenience of the system.\n",
            "Like other automakers, Ford markets BlueCruise as an active safety feature, but I see them more as convenience features designed to take some of the stress out of long highway trips and stop-and-go traffic.\n",
            "I used BlueCruise for about an hour of driving, and I only had to disengage it twice: once when the system seemed to be steering toward a row of yellow barrels that mark the barrier between the highway and the off-ramp and another time when another vehicle merged dangerously in front of me.\n",
            "Otherwise, it worked like a charm.\n",
            "Inside the F-150 Lightning will be a familiar world to many truck owners — with a few caveats.\n",
            "F-150 owners will recognize delightful features such as the gear shift that folds down to allow for an expanded workstation in the center console, with enough space for a laptop, a pad of paper, or even your lunch.\n",
            "For people who spend a lot of time in their trucks — while charging, perhaps — the two front seats can fold back pretty much totally flat.\n",
            "I didn't attempt a nap, but I was tempted.\n",
            "The center stack touchscreen — standard 12-inch landscape or optional 15.5-inch portrait style — is the heart of the interior.\n",
            "The portrait-style touchscreen is similar to what's found in the Mustang Mach-E and will likely become an optional feature for all F-series trucks in the near future.\n",
            "The screen runs Ford's Sync 4A, which is the latest version of the automaker's infotainment system that debuted in the Mustang Mach-E.\n",
            "It pretty much operates in a two-pane layout, with the top two-thirds dedicated to navigation or media controls and the bottom third for climate and other vehicle functions.\n",
            "It also features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto if you'd rather just work with the apps on your phone.\n",
            "That said, Sync 4A works pretty seamlessly, with minimal lag when switching between menus.\n",
            "There are four drive modes: normal, sport, tow/haul, and off-road.\n",
            "On surface roads, I stuck to normal, occasionally switching to sport when it seemed fit.\n",
            "The graphic display in the instrument cluster let me know how much power I was sending back to the battery through regenerative braking, which was useful information to see.\n",
            "The F-150 Lightning does not feature a heads-up display, though Ford's engineers hinted that it could be coming to future models.\n",
            "So I'll just come right out and say it: I suck at driving large vehicles.\n",
            "And when those large vehicles are attached to other equally large vehicles, my skills are questionable at best.\n",
            "While towing a 24-foot-long speedboat out of a winery parking lot, I practically obliterated a metal-and-plastic sign standing outside the entrance.\n",
            "I'm fine admitting this.\n",
            "It's good to know your limitations.\n",
            "I took some comfort from the security guard who told me I wasn't the only one to do this.\n",
            "Perhaps I was paying too close attention to the wealth of information provided on the gauge cluster to notice the sign being crushed under the wheels of the boat behind me.\n",
            "Ford went the extra mile in taking a lot of the guesswork out of towing, enabling owners to create a profile based on the object being towed.\n",
            "In the case of the 8,000-pound boat, I could see that the added weight would shave almost 100 miles off my range, from 250 miles on a full charge to 161.7 miles.\n",
            "The experience of driving the F-150 Lightning while towing a boat felt pretty choppy.\n",
            "(Pun intended!)\n",
            "I could feel the weight tugging on the steering wheel while accelerating along a windy road.\n",
            "In other words, it wasn't effortless, nor should it be.\n",
            "It's important for drivers to be aware of the weight that they're towing.\n",
            "On the other hand, hauling less than a thousand pounds of plywood was pretty effortless.\n",
            "After about 15 minutes, I almost forgot the wood was strapped down in the bed of the truck.\n",
            "Ford says the standard range versions of the Pro, XLT, and Lariat trims can tow a maximum of 7,700 pounds, while the extended range versions can take up to 10,000 pounds.\n",
            "The payload is rated for either 1,850 pounds or 2,235 pounds, depending on the trim level.\n",
            "Another confession: off-roading in the F-150 Lightning was very, very fun.\n",
            "I drove over large, beach ball-sized rocks, down extremely steep loose-gravel roads, and through several deep puddles.\n",
            "The truck dispatched each challenge with relative ease.\n",
            "(Shout out to Ford's spotters who made sure I didn't drive off a cliff.)\n",
            "The course included two large holes into which I was directed to steer the truck's front and rear driver-side tires.\n",
            "I was now stuck — or so I thought.\n",
            "Switching on the F-150 Lightning's electronic-locking rear differential, which is housed in the rear axle and, when activated, allows both wheels on a specific axle to turn at the same speed, did the trick.\n",
            "I even attempted it without the rear differential activated, and while it took a little more effort, it still made it out.\n",
            "Old F-150's featured ELD as a physical knob; in the Lightning, it's located in a submenu of the touchscreen.\n",
            "Naturally, off-roading is more energy-intensive than normal driving.\n",
            "Ford accounts for this with its off-road driving mode, which offers real-time range estimates and independent front and rear suspension.\n",
            "The software factors in not just weather and traffic conditions, but it also uses an onboard scale to measure the weight of any payload or towing weight.\n",
            "Based on my limited time with it, the F-150 Lightning is a great truck.\n",
            "It handles well, features a lot of cool tech, and will exceed the expectations of anyone who likes towing, hauling, or off-roading.\n",
            "(Ford insists this includes 80 percent of its customers.)\n",
            "Unfortunately, most people won't get to experience the F-150 Lightning's unique charms — at least, not this year.\n",
            "The number of electric F-150s Ford planned on making in its first few years of production has been a bit of a shifting target.\n",
            "At first, the company was only targeting 40,000 vehicles annually, eventually telling suppliers it expected that capacity to rise to 80,000 by early 2023.\n",
            "Now, that number has risen to 150,000 trucks by mid-2023 — though it's unclear how many will reach customers this year.\n",
            "The company is using a “wave-by-wave reservation process” to inform customers when they can go online to spec out their Lightnings.\n",
            "(Reservations are still closed as of the publication of this article.)\n",
            "The challenges of ramping up production on a hotly anticipated EV are not unique to Ford.\n",
            "The entire auto industry is struggling to meet demand for electric vehicles, especially as high gas prices have consumers casting about for more affordable options.\n",
            "Parts are in short supply, especially materials for lithium-ion batteries.\n",
            "While stopped at a traffic light north of San Antonio, a man in a Ford Escape pulls up next to me and asks how I'm liking it.\n",
            "I tell him, “I'll show you,” and as soon as the light turns green, I punch it, blasting ahead to the next light.\n",
            "Eventually, the man catches up and lets out a whistle of approval.\n",

            "On an earnings call earlier today, Disney CEO Bob Chapek sounded like someone who has clear ideas of ESPN's fully streaming future.\n",
            "He told analysts and investors that “when it comes time to actually pull the trigger,” he believes ESPN can create “the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to the superfan who loves sports,” and “I think there's nobody but ESPN who could frankly pull that off.”\n",
            "This isn't the first time we've heard a Disney exec reference the potential of ESPN streaming — former CEO Bob Iger said in 2015 that it will happen eventually but projected the possibility as more than five years out.\n",
            "In contrast, Chapek said Disney isn't ready to share the specifics of its model on how long it would take to reach profitability or the impact such a shift would have on its existing cable ESPN business deals, without bothering to include any far-off timetables as reassurance for his cable partners.\n",
            "The conversation kicked off because one analyst asked what's holding the company back from making ESPN Plus a fully a la carte sports network.\n",
            "As it is, the subscription offers occasional simulcasts of ESPN's cable networks, as well as some exclusive streaming programming, but it can't replace traditional ESPN for most viewers, and there's a big reason why: money.\n",
            "As Chapek acknowledged in his response, legacy linear networks like ESPN and the cable fees they bring in are “huge cash generators,” which creates Disney's hesitancy to upset the existing business model too early.\n",
            "The not-so-slow collapse of cable companies' subscriber numbers due to cord-cutting is no secret.\n",
            "At its peak in 2010, the US had around 105 million pay-TV households.\n",
            "A report in March from Leichtman Research Group tracking the biggest cable, satellite, and fiber pay-tv companies in the US saw their subscriber counts fall by about 5.5 million in 2021 following a loss of 5.78 million in 2020, leaving their numbers for the start of 2022 at around 68.1 million.\n",
            "However, he continued on, “At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC [direct-to-consumer, aka streaming] area of ESPN, so what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now.”\n",
            "“But what we know is at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN  DTC offering, the way that you describe, and we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN Plus in a full DTC expression.”\n",
            "This is a balance that Disney has done plenty to upset already by shifting its focus away from cable channels with the launch of Disney Plus, and similar to the one that Warner is navigating with HBO and HBO Max.\n",
            "Traditional pay-TV setups (including online streaming like Disney offers via Hulu with Live TV) still have too much impact on Disney's bottom line for Disney to bypass them and launch the full ESPN experience as its own streaming subscription as it has been for many years, but the point where that will change is close enough that Chapek is comfortable openly entertaining the possibilities.\n",
            "On an earnings call earlier today, Disney CEO Bob Chapek sounded like someone who has clear ideas of ESPN's fully streaming future.\n",
            "He told analysts and investors that “when it comes time to actually pull the trigger,” he believes ESPN can create “the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to the superfan who loves sports,” and “I think there's nobody but ESPN who could frankly pull that off.”\n",
            "This isn't the first time we've heard a Disney exec reference the potential of ESPN streaming — former CEO Bob Iger said in 2015 that it will happen eventually but projected the possibility as more than five years out.\n",
            "In contrast, Chapek said Disney isn't ready to share the specifics of its model on how long it would take to reach profitability or the impact such a shift would have on its existing cable ESPN business deals, without bothering to include any far-off timetables as reassurance for his cable partners.\n",
            "The conversation kicked off because one analyst asked what's holding the company back from making ESPN Plus a fully a la carte sports network.\n",
            "As it is, the subscription offers occasional simulcasts of ESPN's cable networks, as well as some exclusive streaming programming, but it can't replace traditional ESPN for most viewers, and there's a big reason why: money.\n",
            "As Chapek acknowledged in his response, legacy linear networks like ESPN and the cable fees they bring in are “huge cash generators,” which creates Disney's hesitancy to upset the existing business model too early.\n",
            "The not-so-slow collapse of cable companies' subscriber numbers due to cord-cutting is no secret.\n",
            "At its peak in 2010, the US had around 105 million pay-TV households.\n",
            "A report in March from Leichtman Research Group tracking the biggest cable, satellite, and fiber pay-tv companies in the US saw their subscriber counts fall by about 5.5 million in 2021 following a loss of 5.78 million in 2020, leaving their numbers for the start of 2022 at around 68.1 million.\n",
            "However, he continued on, “At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC [direct-to-consumer, aka streaming] area of ESPN, so what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now.”\n",
            "“But what we know is at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN  DTC offering, the way that you describe, and we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN Plus in a full DTC expression.”\n",
            "This is a balance that Disney has done plenty to upset already by shifting its focus away from cable channels with the launch of Disney Plus, and similar to the one that Warner is navigating with HBO and HBO Max.\n",
            "Traditional pay-TV setups (including online streaming like Disney offers via Hulu with Live TV) still have too much impact on Disney's bottom line for Disney to bypass them and launch the full ESPN experience as its own streaming subscription as it has been for many years, but the point where that will change is close enough that Chapek is comfortable openly entertaining the possibilities.\n",

            "The tech industry trade groups NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) managed to block HB 20 in court last year, but that victory has been undone by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which today granted Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's request for a stay in NetChoice and CCIA v. Paxton.\n",

            "That includes giant networks like Facebook but also many smaller sites and apps.\n",
            "It also applies rules specifically to email providers.\n",
            "It's an unprecedented decision to let state governments control how companies moderate websites.\n",

            "But it's not yet clear what the decision practically means for Texas residents or others on the internet.\n",
            "The rule applies to decisions made after the law takes effect, so aggrieved users can't sue over past conflicts with the services.\n",
            "Google didn't immediately respond to questions about whether it would change its policies.\n",

            "It doesn't conform to the typical design conventions used by other midrange tablets, but the differences allow for some interesting applications that other tablets might struggle to replicate.\n",
            "This is the lowest price we've seen for this tablet (with or without the added stylus).\n",
            "Easily the most distinctive feature of the Yoga Tab 11 is its large, adjustable handle.\n",
            "Besides providing a convenient way to hang the tablet on a variety of surfaces, this also allows the tablet to serve as an external monitor for any device that can be connected either via USB-C.\n",
            "The extended area that juts from the tablet also houses the large stereo speaker, lending it a much broader sound profile.\n",
            "The 11-inch touchscreen display has a resolution of 2000 x 1200 with a refresh rate of 60Hz and support for Dolby Vision, which allows for greater depth of color.\n",
            "While some of these features may give the Yoga Tab 11 the appearance of a laptop, it still runs Android 11 and uses a MediaTek Helio G90T mobile CPU, though its 4GB of RAM makes it slightly more capable when running several apps in tandem.\n",
            "While the tablet is packaged with 128GB of storage, the Tab 11 also features a microSD card slot if you need some additional space.\n",
            "Yoga Tab 11 is nearing the end of its supported life, however, which is important to note.\n",
            "The Yoga Tab 11 has a handle affixed to the back also allows the tablet to hang somewhere convenient or prop itself up.\n",
            "This model comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage out of the box, however, thanks to its microSD card slot, you can upgrade it post-purchase.\n",
            "The low-end Android tablet also has a display resolution of 2000 x 1200 and features an 8MP front-facing camera for video chatting, as well as a 13MP rear camera for taking photos.\n",
            "While the P11 Plus is compatible with an optional keyboard dock, the tablet's MediaTek Helio G90T processor and limited RAM prevent it from performing much heavy lifting, rendering it more suitable for light browsing and media consumption.\n",
            "This 11-inch tablet from Lenovo features a 128GB storage capacity and 4GB of RAM.\n",
            "The P11 Plus uses the Android 10 OS and has a screen resolution of 2000 x 1200.\n",
            "If you don't mind a limited port selection and are in need of a tablet that offers plenty of performance in a lightweight chassis, Microsoft's high-powered Surface Pro 8 might fit the bill.\n",
            "The attractive, modern slate feature a 13-inch touchscreen, along with 2880 x 1920 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate — a rarity outside of the gaming sphere.\n",
            "It's also a great teleconferencing device thanks to its far-field studio microphones and 5MP front-facing camera.\n",
            "Best of all, it serves as a competent stand-in laptop when using the integrated kickstand and the optional keyboard cover.\n",
            "This particular model comes with an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD.\n",
            "If you need extra room, you can always expand the storage of this tablet down the line with microSD cards.\n",
            "Read our review.\n",
            "The new Surface Pro 8 is Microsoft's biggest upgrade in years.\n",
            "The excellent 2-in-1 touts Thunderbolt 4 support, a 120Hz display, a better camera, and a more modern design.\n",
            "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE and S7 Plus still manage to hold their own, even with the recent release of the Tab S8 series.\n",
            "Both can run on Android 12, feature quad-speaker systems, and come packaged with Samsung's S Pen.\n",
            "While both tablets are roughly the same size, the S7 Plus is clearly the more powerful tablet, one that boasts a more powerful Snapdragon 865+ chip, a better camera array, more RAM, and an OLED display.\n",
            "The S7 FE, by comparison, uses an LCD panel with a 778G Snapdragon processor and is limited to 4GB of RAM in its 64GB configuration.\n",
            "This is the best discount we've ever seen on this tablet, however, given the recent introduction of the S8 line, we don't expect retailers — including Samsung — to offer either model much longer.\n",
            "Read our S7 and S7 Plus reviews.\n",
            "This budget model of the S7 tablet lineup uses a larger 12.4-inch screen than the standard S7 but is powered by a less powerful 778G Snapdragon processor.\n",
            "The S7 Plus is slightly more expensive than the standard model, yet it features a 12.4-inch OLED display as opposed to the LCD display found on the standard S7.\n",
            "You'll also receive a free pair of Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 in the lavender colorway when you purchase any of the three tablets.\n",
            "While there are some clear upgrades across the S8 line, there are a number of similarities as well.\n",
            "They all use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, feature quad-speaker arrays, run on Android 12, and come packaged with a Samsung S Pen stylus.\n",
            "Each model also supports Wi-Fi 6E and comes equipped with a minimum of 8GB of RAM, but the S8 Ultra is available in 12GB and 16GB configurations as well.\n",
            "The S8 and S8 Plus essentially serve as direct replacements for their Tab S7 predecessors, while the S8 Ultra is a more feature-packed model with support for 5G connectivity and a 14.6-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2960 x 1848 resolution.\n",
            "During our time testing the S8 and S8 Plus, we like the fidelity of the display paired with the performance provided by the upgraded CPU.\n",
            "The form factor for both models was also particularly slim and lightweight, lending them exceptional portability.\n",
            "However, while both models play well with other devices in the Samsung ecosystem, Android apps still struggle with optimization for tablets.\n",
            "Read our reviews of the Galaxy Tab S8 and S8 Plus\n",
            "We were also impressed with the OLED display on the S8 Ultra, and its incredible performance.\n",
            "However, despite its attempts to bring iPad-level productivity to an Android tablet, neither the OS nor the additional keyboard case is really up to the task.\n",
            "Read our review of the S8 Ultra.\n",
            "The standard model of the Galaxy Tab S8 features an 11-inch LCD display with 2560 x 1600 resolution.\n",
            "The base model also has 8GB of RAM and can be configured to include either 128GB or 256GB of storage out of the box.\n",
            "The Galaxy Tab A7 is a fantastic budget-conscious Android tablet that's currently available for its lowest price ever at Best Buy.\n",
            "This 10.4-inch tablet features a 1080p display and a battery that's capable of supporting up to 10 hours of video streaming, which teams up perfectly with the robust sound quality provided by its speakers.\n",
            "The build quality of this 32GB tablet is excellent and is compatible with microSD storage if you need a little extra space for apps.\n",
            "Unless the tablet you're shopping for needs to double as a workstation or have an excellent camera, the Tab A7 handles the basics at a very approachable price.\n",
            "Read our review.\n",
            "If you're in the market for a barebones entertainment device — whether for yourself or your kids — the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a tablet to consider, one that essentially functions as a smaller and less powerful version of the standard A7.\n",
            "The 8.7-inch display offers just 1340 x 800 resolution, though the base model also comes equipped with 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, just like the larger model.\n",
            "While it is less powerful, it's also difficult to find a tablet with these specs that's available at this price point.\n",
            "The A7 and A7 Lite are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor and a Mediatek Helio P22T CPU, respectively.\n",
            "While the Snapdragon 662 is marginally more powerful than the Helio P22T, neither processor is particularly well suited to do much heavy lifting.\n",
            "They'll easily handle media streaming, but our advice is to use these tablets for play, not work.\n",
            "Samsung's Galaxy Tab A7 features a vibrant, colorful display, decent speakers, and solid build quality.\n",
            "This tablet is a great tertiary device for entertainment at an affordable price point.\n",
            "The standard model of the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a smaller, more affordable version of the Tab A7 that features an 8.7-inch display and 1340 x 800 resolution.\n",

            "The Nintendo Switch may feel like an aging console these days, as it's five years old, but it's still bolstered by excellent first-party Nintendo titles and a wealth of indie games — all of which you can take on the go or play docked on a TV.\n",
            "While many fans are thirsty for some kind of 4K-capable Switch Pro, there's a reason Nintendo continues to have strong sales, even if it may have peaked.\n",

            "Microsoft Edge, the Chromium-based browser that is built into current versions of Windows, has its share of protections as well — it's even adding its own VPN to the mix.\n",

            "Here are instructions on how to change your settings, see what trackers are stored on your browser, and delete any cookies.\n",
            "We also address how Edge deals with fingerprinting, another method of tracking that identifies users by collecting details about their system configuration.\n",
            "Edge blocks trackers by default using one of three different levels of protection.\n",
            "Balanced, which is active upon installation, blocks some third-party trackers along with any trackers designated as “malicious.” This mode takes into account sites you visit frequently and the fact that an organization may own several sites; it lowers tracking prevention for organizations you engage with regularly.\n",
            "Basic offers more relaxed control; it still blocks trackers but only those Microsoft describes as “malicious.” You can also switch to Strict, which blocks most third-party trackers across sites.\n",
            "To change your level of protection:\n",
            "While Edge provides you with the three easy-to-choose tracking modes, you can also dive deeper to see which trackers are blocked and make exceptions for specific sites.\n",
            "When you're at a site, you can see how effective your tracking prevention is by clicking on the lock symbol on the left side of the top address field.\n",
            "The drop-down box allows you to view the associated cookies and site permissions, allow or disable pop-ups, tweak the tracking permissions for that site, and see what trackers have been blocked.\n",
            "Conveniently, Edge can delete several types of data each time you close it, including browsing history, passwords, and cookies.\n",
            "You can also manually clear your cookies and other data at any point:\n",
            "There are other privacy features on the Privacy, search, and services page, including options to send “Do Not Track” requests.\n",
            "(Although the usefulness of such a request can be questionable.)\n",

            "There is also a feature that will stop you from accidentally going to a problematic site due to a mistype.\n",
            "According to Microsoft, the three tracking prevention modes will help protect against the type of personalization that leads to fingerprinting.\n",
            "Edge does not block ads natively, but you can download ad-blocking extensions.\n",

            "The app, in turn, told me I'm about 80 percent of the way there already and recommended I increase my caloric intake by 10–15 percent, add more protein to my diet, and do no more than three workouts per week.\n",
            "The best part is that weight is not a big focus of this app.\n",
            "You do have to input it initially, but even if you set your goal to lose fat, it never recommends that you “lose weight.” Instead, it recommends that you reduce your carb and sweets intake for two weeks and cross-train.\n",

            "With its latest product, the Govee DreamView G1 Pro Gaming Light, it brings this formula to desktop computers and gaming monitors.\n",
            "There's no separate control box for the wiring, as the 56-inch flexible light strip and two 17-inch light bars plug right into the camera via USB-C, and the whole kit thankfully takes up just one power outlet.\n",
            "Like the TV bias lights, the camera uses a fisheye lens to view your whole monitor, and it attaches with a claw-like pressure clamp and some 3M adhesive.\n",
            "You do have to be comfortable with applying plenty of 3M adhesive on the back of your monitor — and for a brief moment, directly on the screen.\n",

            "The quick-start guide walks you through setting it up on 16:9 and ultrawide 21:9 displays, curved or flat, ranging from 24 to 30 inches.\n",
            "My monitor is a 30-inch Dell with a less common 16:10 aspect ratio, but it worked fine with the included 16:9 sizing guide.\n",
            "Govee notes that your monitor must have a smooth back for the clips to adhere to, so if you have a monitor with a whole lot of busy paneling and seam breaks, it may be more difficult to mount the main LED strip.\n",
            "The light strip itself is encased in a soft, rubbery material, and it's very flexible.\n",
            "I much prefer this design to the usual tape-style strip of LED lights on other products and Govee's TV kits.\n",
            "It makes the strip much thicker, but it also gives the lighting a softer glow, reducing hotspots (where you can see each individual LED reflected back) if your monitor is right against a wall.\n",
            "It also makes installing, removing, and reinstalling the strip much easier — which was helpful for me, as I first ran the strip backward and had to change it later.\n",
            "Govee's instructions had a small conflict between the text and pictures, telling you to run the strip counterclockwise from the top but showing an example picture that only fits one way: clockwise.\n",
            "This reversed the lighting at first, and you can't swap its orientation with software.\n",
            "Thankfully, popping out the strip and re-mounting it to correct this mistake was fairly painless.\n",
            "Once the strip is installed, you set up and plug in the two light bars about 12 inches from your monitor.\n",
            "The free-standing light bars should be about 12 inches away from your display or they can bleed light into the camera's view and mess up the automatic lighting, so be sure that you have adequate desk space.\n",

            "Turning on the lights and running the initial setup in the Govee Home app on your phone to connect it via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is when we get to everyone's most anxiety-inducing part of the install: temporarily sticking seven small foam cubes to your monitor's panel so the Govee camera knows where to read color info from.\n",
            "While I was a bit cavalier with my old monitor that's nearing its 10th birthday and ran through this quickly and easily, I understand if you bought a fancy new monitor and this step gives you pause.\n",
            "The adhesive on these cubes is high quality enough to not leave any residue — just be sure to pull from one side of the cube when removing instead of pulling it off flat.\n",
            "The very last step of calibration is mapping out the five sections of your strip in the app to ensure it illuminates the right areas to match up with the corners of your screen.\n",

            "While movie mode is much more hands-off, with only options for controlling how varied the light is displayed across the strip and bars (from one solid color to individual segments), game mode has four themed display types — story, action, shoot, and racing.\n",
            "These are designed for different types of games, though the different behavior between all four of them at times felt a little random.\n",

            "Update May 9th, 3:30PM ET: This article has been updated to reflect that the Govee DreamView G1 Pro is now available for purchase.\n",
            "Govee has carved out an interesting niche in TV bias lights that use a mounted camera to match the lighting to what's on-screen.\n",
            "With its latest product, the Govee DreamView G1 Pro Gaming Light, it brings this formula to desktop computers and gaming monitors.\n",
            "There's no separate control box for the wiring, as the 56-inch flexible light strip and two 17-inch light bars plug right into the camera via USB-C, and the whole kit thankfully takes up just one power outlet.\n",
            "Like the TV bias lights, the camera uses a fisheye lens to view your whole monitor, and it attaches with a claw-like pressure clamp and some 3M adhesive.\n",
            "You do have to be comfortable with applying plenty of 3M adhesive on the back of your monitor — and for a brief moment, directly on the screen.\n",
            "Thankfully, the install is otherwise fairly straightforward and easy.\n",
            "The quick-start guide walks you through setting it up on 16:9 and ultrawide 21:9 displays, curved or flat, ranging from 24 to 30 inches.\n",
            "My monitor is a 30-inch Dell with a less common 16:10 aspect ratio, but it worked fine with the included 16:9 sizing guide.\n",
            "Govee notes that your monitor must have a smooth back for the clips to adhere to, so if you have a monitor with a whole lot of busy paneling and seam breaks, it may be more difficult to mount the main LED strip.\n",
            "The light strip itself is encased in a soft, rubbery material, and it's very flexible.\n",
            "I much prefer this design to the usual tape-style strip of LED lights on other products and Govee's TV kits.\n",
            "It makes the strip much thicker, but it also gives the lighting a softer glow, reducing hotspots (where you can see each individual LED reflected back) if your monitor is right against a wall.\n",
            "It also makes installing, removing, and reinstalling the strip much easier — which was helpful for me, as I first ran the strip backward and had to change it later.\n",
            "Govee's instructions had a small conflict between the text and pictures, telling you to run the strip counterclockwise from the top but showing an example picture that only fits one way: clockwise.\n",
            "This reversed the lighting at first, and you can't swap its orientation with software.\n",
            "Thankfully, popping out the strip and re-mounting it to correct this mistake was fairly painless.\n",
            "Once the strip is installed, you set up and plug in the two light bars about 12 inches from your monitor.\n",
            "The free-standing light bars should be about 12 inches away from your display or they can bleed light into the camera's view and mess up the automatic lighting, so be sure that you have adequate desk space.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "To actually use the Govee DreamView G1, you must agree to the following in the Govee Home app (iOS and Android):\n",
            "Total: two required agreements.\n",
            "Turning on the lights and running the initial setup in the Govee Home app on your phone to connect it via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is when we get to everyone's most anxiety-inducing part of the install: temporarily sticking seven small foam cubes to your monitor's panel so the Govee camera knows where to read color info from.\n",
            "While I was a bit cavalier with my old monitor that's nearing its 10th birthday and ran through this quickly and easily, I understand if you bought a fancy new monitor and this step gives you pause.\n",
            "The adhesive on these cubes is high quality enough to not leave any residue — just be sure to pull from one side of the cube when removing instead of pulling it off flat.\n",
            "The very last step of calibration is mapping out the five sections of your strip in the app to ensure it illuminates the right areas to match up with the corners of your screen.\n",
            "With the camera and lights installed and initially calibrated, the DreamView G1 Pro starts displaying colorful light based on what's on your screen.\n",

            "Asus did it.\n",
            "It's made a dual-screen laptop that — and there was a time when I never thought I'd be saying these words — is actually pretty good.\n",
            "Like previous models in the Duo line, there's a big 14.5-inch screen on the top and a smaller 12.7-inch screen on the back of the keyboard deck (the ScreenPad Plus).\n",
            "Below that screen is the keyboard (reaching all the way to the front of said deck), with a teensy touchpad crammed to its right.\n",
            "But the company has made a small tweak that has made the experience significantly more comfortable: it has raised the secondary screen by 12 degrees.\n",
            "This, reader, has changed everything.\n",
            "You see, last year's 14-inch Zenbook Duo model only tilted the secondary screen up by seven degrees.\n",
            "The 2020 model was even flatter.\n",
            "In both cases, I was constantly craning my neck to lean over whenever I needed to see anything on the second screen.\n",
            "The increase to 12 degrees doesn't look huge on paper, but it's finally — finally — made the screen just high enough that I no longer need to crane.\n",
            "Right now, as I type this, I am leaning back in my office chair.\n",
            "I am actually reclining slightly.\n",
            "I can see the Pro Duo's primary screen and can also see the content of its secondary screen just fine.\n",
            "I can read the words on the secondary screen in this reclined state.\n",
            "There are other various tweaks that make the secondary screen significantly easier to see from a distance than it has been in the past.\n",
            "For one, it's brighter than last year's, now reaching 500 nits.\n",
            "It's also higher resolution (2880 x 864).\n",
            "And there's a new “anti-glare etching” that keeps it from reflecting ceiling light, which has been a nuisance in the past.\n",
            "Folks, the second screen is… actually useful now.\n",
            "On previous models, it's just been a place to throw distractions like Slack and Twitter while my real work happened on the top half.\n",
            "Now, I can keep reference materials down there to glance at and read while I work.\n",
            "Now, does that mean its benefits finally outweigh the compromises required in order to fit a whole second screen onto this laptop?\n",
            "For me, no.\n",
            "But we're at the point where that's really just a preference for keyboard location.\n",
            "Asus has fixed basically everything else.\n",
            "For example, ScreenXpert.\n",
            "This software allows the Duo's two screens to work together and has come a long way from the glitchy and unresponsive mess it once was.\n",
            "The new version that's on this device (ScreenXpert 3) looks significantly more professional than previous iterations.\n",
            "It's all snappy to use, and windows resized the way they were supposed to.\n",
            "And while I occasionally had to tap a button a couple times to get something to open, that was the extent of the issues I had.\n",
            "It's intuitive with a remarkably easy learning curve, which has not always been the case with ScreenXpert software.\n",
            "There's a taskbar (like a floating miniature Windows taskbar) with quick buttons for various features like toggling brightness, phone mirroring, opening an app navigation screen, locking the keyboard, and making all the windows on the ScreenPad disappear to display the desktop background.\n",
            "I was prepared to complain about the questionable utility of some of these, but it turns out that there is some amount of customization you can do in the Control Center Settings panel, which I found after a bit of exploring.\n",
            "You can also adjust the taskbar's location by dragging it to the bottom or either side.\n",
            "I remain a fan of the task groups feature (also accessible from this taskbar) which allows you to “save” a configuration of tabs and apps in an arrangement of your choice to open again at a later date.\n",
            "This is something I use a lot on Duo devices.\n",
            "The other fix I'm very happy about pertains to the touchpad.\n",
            "The Duo 14's touchpad is so tiny as to be basically useless.\n",
            "On previous models, I've just used a stylus for every possible situation.\n",
            "That's what I was doing here — until I discovered TouchPad mode.\n",
            "Touchpad mode allows you to turn the ScreenPad into a giant touchpad.\n",
            "All you have to do is tap it with three fingers.\n",
            "To turn it back into a ScreenPad, you tap an X in the top-right corner.\n",
            "The touchpad works well and is as responsive to all the various gestures as a regular one would be.\n",
            "There are downsides, of course.\n",
            "For one, there's no clicking mechanism (but tap-to-click does work well).\n",
            "You also are reaching over the keyboard to use it, which is a bit weird (but something I got used to).\n",
            "And the touchpad interface is opaque, so when you have it pulled up, you can't see the other content that you have sitting on the ScreenPad.\n",
            "I hope Asus is able to make it even the tiniest bit more translucent in the future, but I'm still very happy to see this feature here.\n",
            "The Intel Core i7-12700H inside is a mainstream processor that we've mostly seen in high-performance gaming laptops and workstations to date, including Alienware's X14.\n",

            "But the company has made a small tweak that has made the experience significantly more comfortable: it has raised the secondary screen by 12 degrees.\n",
            "This, reader, has changed everything.\n",
            "You see, last year's 14-inch Zenbook Duo model only tilted the secondary screen up by seven degrees.\n",
            "The 2020 model was even flatter.\n",

            "But we're at the point where that's really just a preference for keyboard location.\n",
            "Asus has fixed basically everything else.\n",
            "For example, ScreenXpert.\n",
            "This software allows the Duo's two screens to work together and has come a long way from the glitchy and unresponsive mess it once was.\n",
            "The new version that's on this device (ScreenXpert 3) looks significantly more professional than previous iterations.\n",
            "It's all snappy to use, and windows resized the way they were supposed to.\n",
            "And while I occasionally had to tap a button a couple times to get something to open, that was the extent of the issues I had.\n",
            "It's intuitive with a remarkably easy learning curve, which has not always been the case with ScreenXpert software.\n",
            "There's a taskbar (like a floating miniature Windows taskbar) with quick buttons for various features like toggling brightness, phone mirroring, opening an app navigation screen, locking the keyboard, and making all the windows on the ScreenPad disappear to display the desktop background.\n",
            "I was prepared to complain about the questionable utility of some of these, but it turns out that there is some amount of customization you can do in the Control Center Settings panel, which I found after a bit of exploring.\n",
            "You can also adjust the taskbar's location by dragging it to the bottom or either side.\n",
            "I remain a fan of the task groups feature (also accessible from this taskbar) which allows you to “save” a configuration of tabs and apps in an arrangement of your choice to open again at a later date.\n",
            "This is something I use a lot on Duo devices.\n",
            "The other fix I'm very happy about pertains to the touchpad.\n",
            "The Duo 14's touchpad is so tiny as to be basically useless.\n",
            "On previous models, I've just used a stylus for every possible situation.\n",
            "That's what I was doing here — until I discovered TouchPad mode.\n",
            "Touchpad mode allows you to turn the ScreenPad into a giant touchpad.\n",
            "All you have to do is tap it with three fingers.\n",
            "To turn it back into a ScreenPad, you tap an X in the top-right corner.\n",
            "The touchpad works well and is as responsive to all the various gestures as a regular one would be.\n",
            "There are downsides, of course.\n",
            "For one, there's no clicking mechanism (but tap-to-click does work well).\n",
            "You also are reaching over the keyboard to use it, which is a bit weird (but something I got used to).\n",
            "And the touchpad interface is opaque, so when you have it pulled up, you can't see the other content that you have sitting on the ScreenPad.\n",
            "I hope Asus is able to make it even the tiniest bit more translucent in the future, but I'm still very happy to see this feature here.\n",

            "Sennheiser's new Momentum True Wireless 3s are the company's latest flagship earbuds.\n",
            "With a more refined style, improved active noise cancellation, new features, and top-notch sound quality, Sennheiser has delivered a worthy competitor to the Apple AirPods Pro, Sony's WF-1000XM4, and Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds.\n",
            "That's still premium pricing, but Sennheiser is now on par with Apple's AirPod Pros and comes in cheaper than both Sony and Bose's flagships.\n",
            "With tech products increasingly creeping up in price every year, it's nice to see one go in the opposite direction for a change — and add new features, to boot.\n",
            "Wireless charging is the most significant upgrade.\n",
            "It was hard to accept the lack of this feature in the Momentum True Wireless 2s.\n",
            "For the price, wireless charging should be table stakes.\n",
            "I'm not sure how it took three tries for Sennheiser to realize that.\n",
            "Another improvement is what comes in the box: Sennheiser gives you four sizes of ear tips — the fourth is an extra small — but with the new model, the company also includes three optional wing fins that wrap around each earbud and tuck into your ears for added stability.\n",
            "The medium size comes preinstalled, but it's easy to remove or replace with a smaller or larger wing if you need to keep the earbuds extra steady and secured in place during a workout or run.\n",
            "Even without the stabilizer fins, the MTW3s took to my ears comfortably and didn't easily come loose.\n",
            "The earbuds are smaller than their predecessors, with a more squared-off outer-facing design that comes in black, grey, or white.\n",
            "My black review unit looks far more subtle in the ear compared to the MTW2s, which have a shiny silver Sennheiser logo.\n",
            "But they still protrude further than something like Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro, so these aren't the most discreet buds around.\n",
            "The charging case also shrank a bit thanks to Sennheiser making better use of space, and the USB-C charging port has been relocated to the front.\n",
            "This can seem odd at first, but it's something other companies like Jabra have started doing as well, and you might find it more convenient depending on where you're charging the MTW3s.\n",
            "Sennheiser has improved the strength of its noise cancellation, though you don't actually have any direct control over how much ANC is applied with the MTW3s.\n",
            "The company uses an adaptive ANC to automatically increase and lower noise cancellation based on your current environment.\n",
            "Other earbud makers have also tried this adaptive approach, though most make it optional rather than the full-time default.\n",
            "I didn't find myself missing manual adjustment while testing these earbuds, but you might prefer more control.\n",
            "The ANC isn't at the same level as Sony or Bose, but it does the trick to help hush nearby distractions.\n",
            "And you always have the ability to activate transparency mode with a tap of the left earbud, though Sennheiser's implementation still doesn't match the same natural sound that Sony, Bose, and Apple have all achieved.\n",
            "When it announced its latest earbuds, Sennheiser didn't make any mention of major changes to their sound.\n",
            "They still use 7-millimeter drivers that are similar to what was inside the MTW2s, and I'd put the overall audio quality in the same ballpark as those and Sennheiser's CX Plus — though these are slightly better and can crank louder in volume.\n",
            "That's a good place to be, as these still sound wonderful.\n",
            "Sennheiser supports AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive Bluetooth codecs, with the latter helping to eliminate any perceptible audio delay when watching videos or playing mobile games on Android.\n",
            "It would've been nice to see Sony's LDAC added to the equation, but that's the kind of omission I can live with, considering the lower price.\n",
            "And AptX Adaptive also has support for higher-res audio than what AAC and SBC allow.\n",
            "Tossing on an old favorite like Buena Vista Social Club, the Sennheisers deliver a very spacious, clean, and detailed sound, with the piano, classical guitars, and vocals all nicely layered without a hint of muddiness.\n",
            "The same held true when I switched between The National, Molly Tuttle, or Bon Iver's “Second Nature” track from Don't Look Up.\n",
            "These earbuds bring out the small touches of a song with very enjoyable clarity.\n",
            "Sennheiser's Smart Control app for iPhone and Android lets you adjust the EQ with bass boost and podcast modes that are separate from any changes you make to the bass, mid, and treble sliders.\n",
            "(The podcast option enhances speech clarity.)\n",
            "The standard consumer-friendly tuning curve is present here, but I'd say the Sennheisers are more balanced than the Sony 1000XM4s.\n",
            "Not everyone will prefer that: I ended up enabling bass boost more often than not, whereas the Sonys deliver powerful, energetic sound out of the box.\n",
            "The mobile app also recently added the option to set up “sound zones” and automatically change the level of noise cancellation and EQ customizations based on where you are — whether it's home, the office, at the gym, or other spots that you frequent.\n",
            "This worked as expected in my tests, but it does require you to grant the Sennheiser app location tracking privileges on your phone.\n",
            "Plus, using Sound Zones (or the Sound Check feature that personalizes your EQ) requires you to set up a Sennheiser account.\n",
            "I'm not a fan of making people sign up for an account just to use earbud features.\n",
            "Some owners of Sennheiser's previous Momentum True Wireless models reported an audible, persistent white noise effect while listening to the buds.\n",
            "Even in a completely silent room, I've noticed no such annoyance with the third-generation pair.\n",
            "Battery life remains unchanged at seven hours of continuous listening, and the earbuds (along with their case) are IPX4 water-resistant, which makes them suitable for routine exercise.\n",
            "Voice call performance seems to have a leg up over the MTW2s, and I didn't get any major complaints about call quality or being hard to understand.\n",
            "These still come up short against recent standouts like Sony's LinkBuds, however.\n",
            "Either earbud can be used by itself while the other charges in the case, and these also have auto-pause whenever you remove one or both buds.\n",
            "The MTW3s weren't completely immune from minor bugs in my time reviewing them: I noticed the occasional (though rare) signal dropout, and the status / prompt voice sometimes quickly said both “disconnected” and then “connected” soon after I removed them from the case and plopped them in my ears.\n",
            "At launch, the new Sennheiser flagship earbuds don't support multipoint Bluetooth, so you're only able to connect to one device at a time.\n",
            "The company has claimed that it's planning to add multipoint in a future firmware update, but as the old adage goes, you should only buy a product based on what it can do right now and not for what might come later.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",

            "You can use Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds without needing to agree to anything.\n",
            "However, if you want to install the companion Smart Control app and customize how they work, then you'll need to agree to:\n",
            "Sennheiser also asks you to share your usage data, but this is optional.\n",
            "If you want to use features including Smart Zones, you must register for a Sennheiser account and share your location data.\n",
            "In total, there are two mandatory agreements to use the app and several optional agreements.\n",
            "If the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3s did have multipoint, I'd consider them a home run and recommend an upgrade for fans of the company's past buds.\n",
            "But even as they are, Sennheiser has done a good job of upping their value while lowering the sticker price.\n",
            "The noise cancellation is better, you now get wireless charging, and they still sound splendid.\n",

            "To button, or not to button?\n",
            "When it comes to wearables, the answer is you should always opt for physical buttons.\n",
            "And while they're abundant on smartwatches, fitness trackers tend to favor touchscreens and capacitive buttons.\n",
            "But it looks like there may be some good news for fans of physical buttons.\n",
            "A new leaked photo of the Fitbit Versa 4 indicates that the side button is back, baby.\n",
            "The photo comes from 9to5Google, and for the most part, it looks almost identical to the Versa 3 — except if you zero in on the right-hand side, where you can see a teeny little raised button.\n",
            "It might not seem like it, but this is actually a significant design change.\n",
            "Earlier iterations of the Versa — one of Fitbit's most popular devices — had a physical side button.\n",
            "Then, with the Versa 3 in 2020, Fitbit did away with it in favor of a smooth indentation.\n",
            "This was technically a “button,” but it wasn't something you could actually press in a traditional sense.\n",
            "Instead, when you squeezed it correctly, the Versa 3 would vibrate.\n",
            "The Fitbit Sense, which came out the same year, also shared the same design.\n",
            "On the surface, this seemed sensible.\n",
            "In theory, no buttons meant no accidental presses and a sleeker profile.\n",
            "In reality, it made for a crappy user experience.\n",
            "If you use too little pressure on the Sense or Versa 3's button, it won't do anything.\n",
            "And if you use too much pressure, it still might not do anything.\n",
            "Or, instead of waking the screen as you intended, you might end up triggering the long-press shortcut instead.\n",
            "For whatever reason, the top half of the button tended to be more responsive than the bottom.\n",
            "If you peruse Fitbit and Reddit forums, you'll find plenty of customers griping and sharing tips on how to make this button work.\n",
            "This isn't a new problem.\n",
            "There are plenty of fitness trackers that don't have any kind of button or crown.\n",
            "Instead, they rely on touchscreens entirely.\n",
            "For instance, with the Garmin Vivosmart 3 and Vivosmart 4, you had to tap the screen to confirm your choices.\n",
            "That meant nailing the perfect cadence and pressure each time.\n",
            "If you didn't master it, it meant a simple two-second task could end up taking several minutes to figure out.\n",
            "And while the Garmin Vivosmart devices are the example I'm using here, there are several touchscreen-only fitness bands out there with the same problems.\n",
            "Sweaty fingers are also an issue.\n",
            "Touchscreens often don't register moist fingers, and they also make it harder to use capacitive buttons.\n",
            "The irony is these are devices meant to be worn while exercising, so they effectively become harder to use just when you need them most.\n",
            "A well-designed physical button is a simple solution to all these problems.\n",
            "When you see a physical button, you don't have to learn how to use it.\n",
            "You just press and it does the thing you want.\n",
            "If you want to get fancy, you can program nifty shortcuts — like pausing your music — and never have to look down at your watch.\n",
            "A physical button does not care how sweaty your fingers are.\n",
            "It will always do its job.\n",
            "I recently reviewed the Garmin Vivosmart 5, and one small change ended up being a game-changer in a tracker series that was always finicky.\n",
            "That change?\n",
            "Adding a physical button.\n",
            "The combination of a touchscreen and a button was perfect.\n",
            "I could use the touchscreen when it made sense, like when scrolling through menus.\n",
            "But I could also always rely on the button to get me back to the homescreen, the previous screen, or end a workout.\n",
            "Adding the button single-handedly eliminated one of the tracker series' worst pain points.\n",
            "This is the most likely reason why — if this leaked photo is to be believed — Fitbit has backpedaled to an older design.\n",
            "It's a smart decision if so, and it's further proof that you get the best wearable experience when you use both a touchscreen and physical buttons.\n",
            "And the Pro 6E certainly delivers.\n",
            "I saw significantly faster speeds over the previous generation Eero Pro 6 in my tests.\n",
            "But I also saw some network drop-offs, which Eero says is an issue around the Thread implementation — a key part of support for the coming smart home standard Matter that Eero has committed to.\n",
            "The overall increased speed is thanks to the new 6GHz Wi-Fi band and some extra 160MHz channels on the 5GHz band.\n",
            "While 6GHz devices are still few and far between, lots of devices can take advantage of the 160MHz channels, and I saw speed boosts on all devices, not just those that could use the new band.\n",
            "This is also the first Eero to support faster than gigabit speeds, so if you have a multi-gigabit connection, you can actually use it.\n",
            "But, as the price reflects, the Eero Pro 6E is not a pro-level router; while it supports incoming wired speeds up to 2.5Gbps, its wireless speeds top out at 1.3Gbps.\n",
            "So, if you have a multi-gigabit connection, you may want to consider a more powerful router.\n",
            "All this means the Pro 6E has a slim target audience; those with gigabit speeds and who have or might have 6GHz capable devices in the future.\n",
            "However, If you are in that audience and are looking for an advanced plug-and-play setup for gigabit internet service, you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "And, as with all Eero devices, the Pro 6E offers a super simple setup, an easy-to-use app interface, and useful features like parental controls and historical network data usage (although these are behind a paywall).\n",
            "What you won't get is a pro setup or management options (despite the name).\n",
            "You can only manage your network through the app, which is fine for most people, but not for true networking geeks.\n",
            "There are only two ethernet ports on each router, so if you need more, you'll have to use a network switch.\n",
            "And Eero's system is entirely cloud-based, which can make it trickier to self-troubleshoot.\n",
            "This also raises privacy implications for the Amazon-owned company (see Smart Home Data Privacy sidebar for more details).\n",
            "Six years ago, Eero launched its first mesh Wi-Fi system with the promise of fixing home Wi-Fi.\n",
            "As one of the earliest consumer mesh routers, Eero offered a simple solution to the complicated problem of home networking.\n",
            "With mesh, instead of having to camp out in front of your modem to get a strong enough signal to FaceTime on your iPad, you could make video calls from the comfort of your bed.\n",
            "Fast forward to today, and the Eero Pro 6E looks to tackle the next home Wi-Fi problem; congestion.\n",
            "Since Wi-Fi has become so ubiquitous and the smart home has proliferated, we've loaded up our networks with gadgets and gizmos galore in every corner of the house.\n",
            "Be it laptops, robot vacuums, televisions, wireless speakers, smart bulbs, or a smart plug or two, most of us have multiple Wi-Fi-dependent devices in our homes.\n",
            "With so many devices competing for coverage, it's easy to make a mesh Wi-Fi system sweat some megabits, dragging down your network and causing real pain.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E aims to fix this by taking advantage of the new 6GHz Wi-Fi band.\n",
            "A tri-band mesh router, it adds this new band to the existing 2.4 and 5GHz bands we're all familiar with.\n",
            "Not to be confused with Wi-Fi 6 (which was more of an incremental upgrade), Wi-Fi 6E adds a whole new frequency band.\n",
            "With its ability to support 160MHz of bandwidth, 6E's 6GHz band let's traffic drive along your network at its top speeds.\n",
            "But, very few devices can use 6GHz yet; it's largely limited to a few high-end smartphones and gaming laptops.\n",
            "If you have one of those devices and aren't satisfied with the speeds you're getting with your current router, upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6E router is an easy choice.\n",
            "Still, even if you don't, there are some reasons to consider the Eero Pro 6E, primarily that it supports 160MHz wide channels on both the 5 and 6GHz bands, which helps reduce congestion on your network and significantly improves speeds.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E retains the same small attractive design as the Pro 6 with just a few minor tweaks.\n",
            "This is a big selling point of Eeros, as they are easy to fit into your home without wanting to hide them in a cupboard.\n",
            "While I appreciate the lack of a “dead black spider” aesthetic here, Google Wi-Fi is still my favorite in terms of design.\n",
            "Under the hood, the Pro 6E has a few key upgrades over the Pro 6, including the addition of that 6GHz channel (which replaces one of the 5GHz channels in the Pro 6, keeping the Pro 6E a tri-band system) and support for 2.5Gbps wired and 1.3Gbps wireless maximum speeds.\n",
            "The Pro 6E is rated as an AX5400 system, which is not quite as high as the other 6E routers on the market, which might have quad-band systems (2.4GHz, 5GHz low, 5GHz high, and 6GHz) or more advanced antenna arrays.\n",
            "This rating is an obtuse way to express the features and theoretical maximums of the wireless speeds from the router but doesn't indicate what speeds you'll actually see when you use it.\n",
            "The Pro 6E supports over 100 devices simultaneously (compared to 75 with the Pro 6).\n",
            "Each Eero node is a complete router with two ethernet ports, but the Pro 6E has a 2.5GbE and a 1.0GbE port to support multi-gig internet, whereas the Pro 6 has two 1.0 GbE ports.\n",
            "Power comes from a USB-C wall adapter.\n",
            "Though the 6E can support incoming internet speeds of greater than one gigabit, since it doesn't have two 2.5GbE ports, the speeds that it can send to your wired devices are capped at a gigabit.\n",
            "Though the Pro 6E is a tri-band mesh system, like the Pro 6 before it, it doesn't technically have a dedicated backhaul channel.\n",
            "Instead, Eero's software “dynamically” chooses which band to use at any given time.\n",
            "The Pro 6E Eeros also support wired backhaul for directly connecting the nodes at 1Gbps speeds.\n",
            "As with the Pro 6, the Pro 6E doubles as a smart home hub, with a thread-capable 802.15.4 radio inside that can act as a Thread border router (you can turn this on or off).\n",
            "It can also connect Zigbee-based lights, locks, and sensors to your network through integration with Amazon Alexa.\n",
            "This integration also lets you use Alexa voice control to manage your network, including turning off Wi-Fi to individual devices or profiles and setting up Routines to manage multiple actions — such as turning off the TV and the kids' Wi-Fi at dinner time.\n",
            "This is a helpful feature and easy to use.\n",
            "The first time I attempted to pause the Wi-Fi to my daughter's iPad, Alexa said, “Daughter's iPad isn't set up for Wi-Fi control.\n",
            "Do you want me to set it up for you and pause the Wi-Fi?” A simple “yes” and the Wi-Fi was off.\n",
            "To unpause Wi-Fi, you need to use the app.\n",
            "Unlike the Pro 6, there is no support for Apple's HomeKit secure router feature on the Pro 6E.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E download speeds were two to six times faster than my previous setup with the Pro 6.\n",
            "I tested the Eeros with a three-pack based on the company's recommendation, even though my home is far smaller than the “6,000 square feet” of coverage the set is claimed to cover.\n",
            "The test environment for this review was a 2,400-square-foot home built in the 1960s.\n",
            "It has three stories with brick walls.\n",
            "As a smart home reviewer, I have an unusually large number of devices on my network, averaging around 105 at any one time.\n",
            "That includes three computers, two smart TVs, multiple smart displays, and several gadgets such as smart light bulbs, switches, robot vacuums, door locks, and such, which are always connected but not always consuming data.\n",
            "I have a 1.2-gigabit Comcast cable internet connection and an Xfinity X1 modem with upload speeds of 35Mbps.\n",
            "I conducted speed tests with a Pixel 6 (that can use the 6GHz band), a MacBook, and an iPhone 13.\n",
            "All three devices saw impressive speed bumps.\n",
            "Standing near the gateway router, the Pixel 6 went from averages of 172Mbps to 713Mbps and — despite the Apple devices not being able to take advantage of the 6GHz band or the 160MHz channels — the iPhone 13 went from 233Mbps to 551Mbps.\n",
            "However, the Pixel 6, which can use both, was significantly faster than the iPhone at each of my four testing locations.\n",
            "Interestingly, the most significant difference was when testing the furthest point from the router; the Pixel 6 saw over six times the speed compared to testing on the Pro 6, whereas the iPhone only increased three times.\n",
            "This indicates that a 6GHz capable and / or 160MHz capable device will get a greater boost with the Eero Pro 6, but all devices should see some benefit.\n",
            "I tested the Pro 6E with a wireless backhaul, as it's not possible to easily wire the nodes directly in my home.\n",
            "Traditionally, this results in a significant drop in speeds, and that was the case here, too.\n",
            "Generally, I got half the speeds wirelessly when next to a node or gateway than I did when my Macbook was wired into the main mode.\n",
            "Bringing connected devices into your home also brings with it concerns about how the data they collect is protected.\n",
            "The Verge asks each company whose smart home products we review about the data it collects and the safeguards it has in place protecting that data.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E is a cloud-based, mesh Wi-Fi system.\n",
            "This means it uses data from your network to dynamically operate, maintain and improve it.\n",
            "Eero says it prioritizes customers' privacy and actively minimizes the amount of personal data needed to operate its devices.\n",
            "Data Eero collects includes your network status, devices that are connected to your Eeros, their assigned IP addresses, signal strength, and data usage.\n",
            "Eero says it uses limited personal information to deliver the expected product functionality and improve the products.\n",
            "For example, Eero uses account setup information — including customer name, email address, and phone number — to provide customer support.\n",
            "It also collects and uses analytics such as device temperature, CPU usage, and wireless signal strength to improve its devices and network performance.\n",
            "Eero devices do not track where you go on the internet, and the company says it has no plans to make that a capability.\n",
            "The devices also do not collect the content of your network traffic.\n",
            "All customer data is stored using industry-standard security techniques such as access control, encryption, monitoring, and security testing.\n",
            "A big selling point of mesh is range — you should be able to walk through your house with a device and keep the same connectivity as it switches from node to node.\n",
            "In testing, this worked well, and I could conduct a Zoom call on my laptop in every corner of the house with no drop off as I moved from room to room.\n",
            "I did get some signal degradation — especially with the MacBook — as it often hung on to one node a little too long.\n",
            "The final and arguably most crucial Wi-Fi test is reliability; it doesn't matter how fast your internet connection is if it isn't working.\n",
            "Here the Eero Pro 6Es struggled with semi-regular connection drops that would sometimes last a few seconds and other times result in having to reboot the whole system.\n",
            "During my two-month testing period, Eero identified an issue with the Thread implementation.\n",
            "According to Eero, a memory leak was causing the devices to reboot briefly.\n",
            "It wasn't clear if this was related to a Thread device on my network or not, although I did see similar reports of dropouts in some user reviews.\n",
            "Turning off the Thread radio in the app helped, and this week, Eero released a software update (6.10) to address the issue.\n",
            "Since the update, and with the Thread radio turned on, my network dropped briefly and reconnected three times in five days, which is still three times more than I'd like to have seen.\n",
            "Because Eero's network management is all cloud-based, when the internet did go down, I had little recourse for troubleshooting other than rebooting the devices.\n",
            "An option in the app ostensibly helps you diagnose network issues, but it requires an internet connection to do so.\n",
            "I have very spotty cellular service in my home, so, in my testing, this wasn't helpful.\n",
            "In that troubleshooting section, there are six options that cover common issues (slow internet, offline, red light on the Eero).\n",
            "These take you to a Health Check page, where it scans the network for issues.\n",
            "Doing this never resolved any problems for me or gave me steps to follow that resolved them, but it did give me the direct line to call Eero support.\n",
            "Getting set up with an Eero network is still very simple, especially if you are upgrading an existing Eero device.\n",
            "It does require a smartphone with an internet connection, however.\n",
            "The entire setup process is done with the Eero app (iOS or Android), and once set up, you use it to manage connected devices, add a guest network, get notified when a new device joins your network, and receive data usage reports (useful if you have a data cap on your network).\n",
            "The app also shows you all the devices connected to your network at a glance.\n",
            "It attempts to give them identifiable names, such as iPhone, Chromecast, and Nest Hub, and is successful about 80 percent of the time.\n",
            "Oddly, it mainly struggled with Amazon Echo devices.\n",
            "While the app pulls in the name, you have to manually assign a device type, such as laptop, phone, game console, digital assistant, or oven — there are plenty to choose from.\n",
            "If you have a very up-to-date smart home, you might have to use a substitute type for some devices, such as a connected kitchen faucet.\n",
            "You can also assign devices to profiles, which let you group them into functions or family members, helpful to see the type of network activity and pause or resume Wi-Fi to specific devices (such as your kids' tablets at dinner time).\n",
            "You can also set up schedules — there's a suggested Bedtime one — to automatically shut off and re-enable Wi-Fi at set times.\n",
            "There is no fee for this feature, though there is if you want actual parental controls.\n",
            "I grouped my devices into categories such as “gaming” and “appliances,” as well as individual family members.\n",
            "This way, I can easily see how much data my dishwasher has been using (9.6 megabytes last month) or that robot vacuum has been uploading (108.5 megabytes).\n",
            "Unlike routers with more advanced management, you are not able to separate out the three networks on Eero's routers.\n",
            "For smart home users, this can cause issues when trying to connect devices that only work on 2.4GHz.\n",
            "However, Eero has a handy feature in the troubleshooting section of the app that lets you temporarily turn off the 5GHz network if you are trying to connect a 2.4GHz device.\n",
            "While there's no quality of service optimization — which would let you prioritize bandwidth to your work computer over, say, your child's Xbox — there is an option to optimize bandwidth for conferencing and gaming in the Eero Labs Beta section.\n",
            "WPA3 support is also in the Beta section\n",
            "These include content filtering, ad blocking, access to historical network data usage, and parental controls.\n",

            "The Eero Pro 6E is an excellent mesh system that continues Eero's reputation of being a simple, easy-to-use consumer router.\n",
            "However, if you don't have any 6E devices, gigabit internet, or plans to upgrade your laptop or phone for a couple of years, there is no reason to upgrade to this router.\n",
            "If you are in the market for a new mesh system, it might be wise to future-proof your setup with a 6E router.\n",
            "A router should last you four or five years, and by that time, 6GHz devices will likely be far more widespread, and maybe you'll have faster home internet than you currently have.\n",
            "Going beyond what the Pro 6E can offer requires both spending more money and being willing to deal with a heavier management overhead.\n",
            "Other consumer-level Wi-Fi 6E routers do offer more management and control options, but they aren't as easy to set up and maintain as the Eero and generally don't have as good a reputation for reliability.\n",
            "Your network admin brother-in-law likely swears by Ubiquiti equipment, but that requires a significant amount of extra hardware, installation, and management to keep running and isn't ideal for someone looking for a plug-and-play option.\n",

            "The overall increased speed is thanks to the new 6GHz Wi-Fi band and some extra 160MHz channels on the 5GHz band.\n",
            "While 6GHz devices are still few and far between, lots of devices can take advantage of the 160MHz channels, and I saw speed boosts on all devices, not just those that could use the new band.\n",
            "This is also the first Eero to support faster than gigabit speeds, so if you have a multi-gigabit connection, you can actually use it.\n",
            "But, as the price reflects, the Eero Pro 6E is not a pro-level router; while it supports incoming wired speeds up to 2.5Gbps, its wireless speeds top out at 1.3Gbps.\n",
            "So, if you have a multi-gigabit connection, you may want to consider a more powerful router.\n",
            "All this means the Pro 6E has a slim target audience; those with gigabit speeds and who have or might have 6GHz capable devices in the future.\n",
            "However, If you are in that audience and are looking for an advanced plug-and-play setup for gigabit internet service, you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "And, as with all Eero devices, the Pro 6E offers a super simple setup, an easy-to-use app interface, and useful features like parental controls and historical network data usage (although these are behind a paywall).\n",
            "What you won't get is a pro setup or management options (despite the name).\n",
            "You can only manage your network through the app, which is fine for most people, but not for true networking geeks.\n",
            "There are only two ethernet ports on each router, so if you need more, you'll have to use a network switch.\n",
            "And Eero's system is entirely cloud-based, which can make it trickier to self-troubleshoot.\n",
            "This also raises privacy implications for the Amazon-owned company (see Smart Home Data Privacy sidebar for more details).\n",
            "Six years ago, Eero launched its first mesh Wi-Fi system with the promise of fixing home Wi-Fi.\n",
            "As one of the earliest consumer mesh routers, Eero offered a simple solution to the complicated problem of home networking.\n",
            "With mesh, instead of having to camp out in front of your modem to get a strong enough signal to FaceTime on your iPad, you could make video calls from the comfort of your bed.\n",
            "Fast forward to today, and the Eero Pro 6E looks to tackle the next home Wi-Fi problem; congestion.\n",
            "Since Wi-Fi has become so ubiquitous and the smart home has proliferated, we've loaded up our networks with gadgets and gizmos galore in every corner of the house.\n",
            "Be it laptops, robot vacuums, televisions, wireless speakers, smart bulbs, or a smart plug or two, most of us have multiple Wi-Fi-dependent devices in our homes.\n",
            "With so many devices competing for coverage, it's easy to make a mesh Wi-Fi system sweat some megabits, dragging down your network and causing real pain.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E aims to fix this by taking advantage of the new 6GHz Wi-Fi band.\n",
            "A tri-band mesh router, it adds this new band to the existing 2.4 and 5GHz bands we're all familiar with.\n",
            "Not to be confused with Wi-Fi 6 (which was more of an incremental upgrade), Wi-Fi 6E adds a whole new frequency band.\n",
            "With its ability to support 160MHz of bandwidth, 6E's 6GHz band let's traffic drive along your network at its top speeds.\n",
            "But, very few devices can use 6GHz yet; it's largely limited to a few high-end smartphones and gaming laptops.\n",
            "If you have one of those devices and aren't satisfied with the speeds you're getting with your current router, upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6E router is an easy choice.\n",
            "Still, even if you don't, there are some reasons to consider the Eero Pro 6E, primarily that it supports 160MHz wide channels on both the 5 and 6GHz bands, which helps reduce congestion on your network and significantly improves speeds.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E retains the same small attractive design as the Pro 6 with just a few minor tweaks.\n",
            "This is a big selling point of Eeros, as they are easy to fit into your home without wanting to hide them in a cupboard.\n",
            "While I appreciate the lack of a “dead black spider” aesthetic here, Google Wi-Fi is still my favorite in terms of design.\n",
            "Under the hood, the Pro 6E has a few key upgrades over the Pro 6, including the addition of that 6GHz channel (which replaces one of the 5GHz channels in the Pro 6, keeping the Pro 6E a tri-band system) and support for 2.5Gbps wired and 1.3Gbps wireless maximum speeds.\n",
            "The Pro 6E is rated as an AX5400 system, which is not quite as high as the other 6E routers on the market, which might have quad-band systems (2.4GHz, 5GHz low, 5GHz high, and 6GHz) or more advanced antenna arrays.\n",
            "This rating is an obtuse way to express the features and theoretical maximums of the wireless speeds from the router but doesn't indicate what speeds you'll actually see when you use it.\n",
            "The Pro 6E supports over 100 devices simultaneously (compared to 75 with the Pro 6).\n",
            "Each Eero node is a complete router with two ethernet ports, but the Pro 6E has a 2.5GbE and a 1.0GbE port to support multi-gig internet, whereas the Pro 6 has two 1.0 GbE ports.\n",
            "Power comes from a USB-C wall adapter.\n",
            "Though the 6E can support incoming internet speeds of greater than one gigabit, since it doesn't have two 2.5GbE ports, the speeds that it can send to your wired devices are capped at a gigabit.\n",
            "Though the Pro 6E is a tri-band mesh system, like the Pro 6 before it, it doesn't technically have a dedicated backhaul channel.\n",
            "Instead, Eero's software “dynamically” chooses which band to use at any given time.\n",
            "The Pro 6E Eeros also support wired backhaul for directly connecting the nodes at 1Gbps speeds.\n",
            "As with the Pro 6, the Pro 6E doubles as a smart home hub, with a thread-capable 802.15.4 radio inside that can act as a Thread border router (you can turn this on or off).\n",
            "It can also connect Zigbee-based lights, locks, and sensors to your network through integration with Amazon Alexa.\n",
            "This integration also lets you use Alexa voice control to manage your network, including turning off Wi-Fi to individual devices or profiles and setting up Routines to manage multiple actions — such as turning off the TV and the kids' Wi-Fi at dinner time.\n",
            "This is a helpful feature and easy to use.\n",
            "The first time I attempted to pause the Wi-Fi to my daughter's iPad, Alexa said, “Daughter's iPad isn't set up for Wi-Fi control.\n",
            "Do you want me to set it up for you and pause the Wi-Fi?” A simple “yes” and the Wi-Fi was off.\n",
            "To unpause Wi-Fi, you need to use the app.\n",
            "Unlike the Pro 6, there is no support for Apple's HomeKit secure router feature on the Pro 6E.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E download speeds were two to six times faster than my previous setup with the Pro 6.\n",
            "I tested the Eeros with a three-pack based on the company's recommendation, even though my home is far smaller than the “6,000 square feet” of coverage the set is claimed to cover.\n",
            "The test environment for this review was a 2,400-square-foot home built in the 1960s.\n",
            "It has three stories with brick walls.\n",
            "As a smart home reviewer, I have an unusually large number of devices on my network, averaging around 105 at any one time.\n",
            "That includes three computers, two smart TVs, multiple smart displays, and several gadgets such as smart light bulbs, switches, robot vacuums, door locks, and such, which are always connected but not always consuming data.\n",
            "I have a 1.2-gigabit Comcast cable internet connection and an Xfinity X1 modem with upload speeds of 35Mbps.\n",
            "I conducted speed tests with a Pixel 6 (that can use the 6GHz band), a MacBook, and an iPhone 13.\n",
            "All three devices saw impressive speed bumps.\n",
            "Standing near the gateway router, the Pixel 6 went from averages of 172Mbps to 713Mbps and — despite the Apple devices not being able to take advantage of the 6GHz band or the 160MHz channels — the iPhone 13 went from 233Mbps to 551Mbps.\n",
            "However, the Pixel 6, which can use both, was significantly faster than the iPhone at each of my four testing locations.\n",
            "Interestingly, the most significant difference was when testing the furthest point from the router; the Pixel 6 saw over six times the speed compared to testing on the Pro 6, whereas the iPhone only increased three times.\n",
            "This indicates that a 6GHz capable and / or 160MHz capable device will get a greater boost with the Eero Pro 6, but all devices should see some benefit.\n",
            "I tested the Pro 6E with a wireless backhaul, as it's not possible to easily wire the nodes directly in my home.\n",
            "Traditionally, this results in a significant drop in speeds, and that was the case here, too.\n",
            "Generally, I got half the speeds wirelessly when next to a node or gateway than I did when my Macbook was wired into the main mode.\n",
            "Bringing connected devices into your home also brings with it concerns about how the data they collect is protected.\n",
            "The Verge asks each company whose smart home products we review about the data it collects and the safeguards it has in place protecting that data.\n",
            "The Eero Pro 6E is a cloud-based, mesh Wi-Fi system.\n",
            "This means it uses data from your network to dynamically operate, maintain and improve it.\n",
            "Eero says it prioritizes customers' privacy and actively minimizes the amount of personal data needed to operate its devices.\n",
            "Data Eero collects includes your network status, devices that are connected to your Eeros, their assigned IP addresses, signal strength, and data usage.\n",
            "Eero says it uses limited personal information to deliver the expected product functionality and improve the products.\n",
            "For example, Eero uses account setup information — including customer name, email address, and phone number — to provide customer support.\n",
            "It also collects and uses analytics such as device temperature, CPU usage, and wireless signal strength to improve its devices and network performance.\n",
            "Eero devices do not track where you go on the internet, and the company says it has no plans to make that a capability.\n",
            "The devices also do not collect the content of your network traffic.\n",
            "All customer data is stored using industry-standard security techniques such as access control, encryption, monitoring, and security testing.\n",
            "A big selling point of mesh is range — you should be able to walk through your house with a device and keep the same connectivity as it switches from node to node.\n",
            "In testing, this worked well, and I could conduct a Zoom call on my laptop in every corner of the house with no drop off as I moved from room to room.\n",
            "I did get some signal degradation — especially with the MacBook — as it often hung on to one node a little too long.\n",
            "The final and arguably most crucial Wi-Fi test is reliability; it doesn't matter how fast your internet connection is if it isn't working.\n",
            "Here the Eero Pro 6Es struggled with semi-regular connection drops that would sometimes last a few seconds and other times result in having to reboot the whole system.\n",
            "During my two-month testing period, Eero identified an issue with the Thread implementation.\n",
            "According to Eero, a memory leak was causing the devices to reboot briefly.\n",
            "It wasn't clear if this was related to a Thread device on my network or not, although I did see similar reports of dropouts in some user reviews.\n",
            "Turning off the Thread radio in the app helped, and this week, Eero released a software update (6.10) to address the issue.\n",
            "Since the update, and with the Thread radio turned on, my network dropped briefly and reconnected three times in five days, which is still three times more than I'd like to have seen.\n",
            "Because Eero's network management is all cloud-based, when the internet did go down, I had little recourse for troubleshooting other than rebooting the devices.\n",
            "An option in the app ostensibly helps you diagnose network issues, but it requires an internet connection to do so.\n",
            "I have very spotty cellular service in my home, so, in my testing, this wasn't helpful.\n",
            "In that troubleshooting section, there are six options that cover common issues (slow internet, offline, red light on the Eero).\n",
            "These take you to a Health Check page, where it scans the network for issues.\n",
            "Doing this never resolved any problems for me or gave me steps to follow that resolved them, but it did give me the direct line to call Eero support.\n",
            "Getting set up with an Eero network is still very simple, especially if you are upgrading an existing Eero device.\n",
            "It does require a smartphone with an internet connection, however.\n",
            "The entire setup process is done with the Eero app (iOS or Android), and once set up, you use it to manage connected devices, add a guest network, get notified when a new device joins your network, and receive data usage reports (useful if you have a data cap on your network).\n",
            "The app also shows you all the devices connected to your network at a glance.\n",
            "It attempts to give them identifiable names, such as iPhone, Chromecast, and Nest Hub, and is successful about 80 percent of the time.\n",
            "Oddly, it mainly struggled with Amazon Echo devices.\n",
            "While the app pulls in the name, you have to manually assign a device type, such as laptop, phone, game console, digital assistant, or oven — there are plenty to choose from.\n",
            "If you have a very up-to-date smart home, you might have to use a substitute type for some devices, such as a connected kitchen faucet.\n",
            "You can also assign devices to profiles, which let you group them into functions or family members, helpful to see the type of network activity and pause or resume Wi-Fi to specific devices (such as your kids' tablets at dinner time).\n",
            "You can also set up schedules — there's a suggested Bedtime one — to automatically shut off and re-enable Wi-Fi at set times.\n",
            "There is no fee for this feature, though there is if you want actual parental controls.\n",
            "I grouped my devices into categories such as “gaming” and “appliances,” as well as individual family members.\n",
            "This way, I can easily see how much data my dishwasher has been using (9.6 megabytes last month) or that robot vacuum has been uploading (108.5 megabytes).\n",
            "Unlike routers with more advanced management, you are not able to separate out the three networks on Eero's routers.\n",
            "For smart home users, this can cause issues when trying to connect devices that only work on 2.4GHz.\n",
            "However, Eero has a handy feature in the troubleshooting section of the app that lets you temporarily turn off the 5GHz network if you are trying to connect a 2.4GHz device.\n",
            "While there's no quality of service optimization — which would let you prioritize bandwidth to your work computer over, say, your child's Xbox — there is an option to optimize bandwidth for conferencing and gaming in the Eero Labs Beta section.\n",
            "WPA3 support is also in the Beta section\n",
            "These include content filtering, ad blocking, access to historical network data usage, and parental controls.\n",

            "The Eero Pro 6E is an excellent mesh system that continues Eero's reputation of being a simple, easy-to-use consumer router.\n",
            "However, if you don't have any 6E devices, gigabit internet, or plans to upgrade your laptop or phone for a couple of years, there is no reason to upgrade to this router.\n",
            "If you are in the market for a new mesh system, it might be wise to future-proof your setup with a 6E router.\n",
            "A router should last you four or five years, and by that time, 6GHz devices will likely be far more widespread, and maybe you'll have faster home internet than you currently have.\n",
            "Going beyond what the Pro 6E can offer requires both spending more money and being willing to deal with a heavier management overhead.\n",
            "Other consumer-level Wi-Fi 6E routers do offer more management and control options, but they aren't as easy to set up and maintain as the Eero and generally don't have as good a reputation for reliability.\n",
            "Your network admin brother-in-law likely swears by Ubiquiti equipment, but that requires a significant amount of extra hardware, installation, and management to keep running and isn't ideal for someone looking for a plug-and-play option.\n",
            "Eero has managed to carve out a niche for itself for those looking for easy-to-use, reliable Wi-Fi coverage in every corner of their home and are willing to pay a premium over basic routers for it.\n",

            "It's a fool's errand, I know, but one I'm happy to accept given the steady advances made by UST projectors over the last few years.\n",
            "These kinds of projectors sit mere inches from the wall, and can save a lot of the cost and hassle that comes with cabling up and mounting a front-projection unit on the other side of the room.\n",
            "My god, what have I done.\n",
            "AWOL Vision is a new brand under Elevation Technology Partners started by co-founders Andy Zhao and Steven Shulman.\n",
            "It has its own in-house teams for software, support, and mechanical and Industrial engineering, Shulman tells me, but maintains a relationship with Hisense in China.\n",
            "Hisense introduced the world's first laser TV back in 2014.\n",
            "Shulman tells me that AWOL owns the intellectual property for its branded projectors and has sole discretion to determine product pricing, sales, and service.\n",
            "Reassuringly, the company recently patched a number of minor bugs and annoyances that were present on the first round of devices that began shipping to Indiegogo backers just weeks ago.\n",
            "The AWOL Vision projector itself isn't exactly small, but typically sized for 4K USTs.\n",
            "Its front profile, when viewed from the couch, is about the size of two high-end soundbars stacked on top of each other.\n",
            "It measures 23.6 x 13.9 x 5.7 inches (599 x 353 x 145 mm) and weighs 27lbs / 12.3kg.\n",
            "The LTV-3500's star feature is its brightness.\n",
            "At 3,500 lumens, it's extremely bright — so bright that the stark white boot-up sequence invokes an involuntary flinch to shield my eyes whenever I start it in a darkened room.\n",
            "And because the projector sits so close to the display surface, most of that light actually reaches the screen to create a highly viewable image even when moderate amounts of ambient light try to interfere.\n",
            "Adding an ALR screen can help compete with overhead light sources and give a boost to contrast and color saturation as demonstrated in the following images.\n",
            "My home is over 180 years old and unsurprisingly has walls that are less than pristine.\n",
            "That's bad for UST projectors which cast light at extreme angles resulting in dark shadows created by raised plaster and holes that resemble dead pixels.\n",
            "My walls therefore benefit greatly from the uniformity of an ALR screen.\n",
            "More importantly, ALR screens help reject ambient light while dramatically increasing contrast.\n",
            "I was sent one of AWOL Vision's ALR Cinematic screens for testing.\n",
            "The screen took two hours to assemble and that's without installing the frame around it or permanently attaching it to my wall.\n",
            "It's leaning against the wall in my setup and far from optimized, which explains the overbleeding light in some of the photos.\n",
            "AWOL's Cinematic ALR screen is specifically designed for UST projectors and claims to improve contrast by 100 times compared to my matte-white walls, while absorbing up to 95 percent of overhead lighting.\n",
            "With an 0.6dB gain it's not going to brighten the image like AWOL's Daylight ALR screens (1.1dB gain) but it does have the advantage of maintaining better viewing angles without the risk of hotspots.\n",
            "I can't vouch for their math, but the photos above showing the projected image split across my wall and the ALR screen at mid-day speak for themselves.\n",

            "The resulting 90-inch image is still enormous, especially compared to my 55-inch TV, but doesn't come close to filling the ALR screen.\n",
            "The AWOL LTV-3500 doesn't run Android TV like many all-in-one projectors.\n",
            "Instead it runs Android 9.0 and bundles the excellent Fire TV Stick 4K Max dongle into the package.\n",

            "Reassuringly, the company recently patched a number of minor bugs and annoyances that were present on the first round of devices that began shipping to Indiegogo backers just weeks ago.\n",
            "The AWOL Vision projector itself isn't exactly small, but typically sized for 4K USTs.\n",
            "Its front profile, when viewed from the couch, is about the size of two high-end soundbars stacked on top of each other.\n",
            "It measures 23.6 x 13.9 x 5.7 inches (599 x 353 x 145 mm) and weighs 27lbs / 12.3kg.\n",
            "The LTV-3500's star feature is its brightness.\n",
            "At 3,500 lumens, it's extremely bright — so bright that the stark white boot-up sequence invokes an involuntary flinch to shield my eyes whenever I start it in a darkened room.\n",
            "And because the projector sits so close to the display surface, most of that light actually reaches the screen to create a highly viewable image even when moderate amounts of ambient light try to interfere.\n",
            "Adding an ALR screen can help compete with overhead light sources and give a boost to contrast and color saturation as demonstrated in the following images.\n",
            "My home is over 180 years old and unsurprisingly has walls that are less than pristine.\n",
            "That's bad for UST projectors which cast light at extreme angles resulting in dark shadows created by raised plaster and holes that resemble dead pixels.\n",
            "My walls therefore benefit greatly from the uniformity of an ALR screen.\n",
            "More importantly, ALR screens help reject ambient light while dramatically increasing contrast.\n",
            "I was sent one of AWOL Vision's ALR Cinematic screens for testing.\n",
            "The screen took two hours to assemble and that's without installing the frame around it or permanently attaching it to my wall.\n",
            "It's leaning against the wall in my setup and far from optimized, which explains the overbleeding light in some of the photos.\n",
            "AWOL's Cinematic ALR screen is specifically designed for UST projectors and claims to improve contrast by 100 times compared to my matte-white walls, while absorbing up to 95 percent of overhead lighting.\n",
            "With an 0.6dB gain it's not going to brighten the image like AWOL's Daylight ALR screens (1.1dB gain) but it does have the advantage of maintaining better viewing angles without the risk of hotspots.\n",
            "I can't vouch for their math, but the photos above showing the projected image split across my wall and the ALR screen at mid-day speak for themselves.\n",
            "The LTV-3500 can produce a 100-inch image when set 9.8 inches from the wall, or a 120-inch image at 13.6 inches.\n",
            "My narrow sideboard only allows me to position it 7.5-inches inches from the wall.\n",
            "The resulting 90-inch image is still enormous, especially compared to my 55-inch TV, but doesn't come close to filling the ALR screen.\n",
            "The AWOL LTV-3500 doesn't run Android TV like many all-in-one projectors.\n",
            "Instead it runs Android 9.0 and bundles the excellent Fire TV Stick 4K Max dongle into the package.\n",
            "The Amazon stick can then be tucked into a specially designed nook on the back of the projector containing an HDMI jack for the stick input and USB to power it.\n",

            "I wanted to love the Garmin Vivosmart 4 back when it launched in 2018.\n",
            "It was a chic yet capable fitness band, with a great set of fitness tracking features for the price.\n",
            "It was almost perfect, except for one major flaw: the touchscreen.\n",
            "Swipes didn't register like they were supposed to, and the capacitive button was even more finicky.\n",
            "There, at the bottom of the display, was a beautiful, physical button.\n",
            "Adding a button might not seem like a game-changer, but in this case, it most certainly is.\n",
            "The Vivosmart lineup has always been plagued by unresponsive touchscreens.\n",
            "Sure, the Vivosmart 4 was an improvement on the Vivosmart 3, but it was still frustrating to use.\n",
            "Swipes wouldn't register properly, and sometimes you ended up smacking your wrist just to start an activity.\n",
            "It's the sort of annoyance that builds up over time until one day you just leave an otherwise excellent tracker to collect dust in a drawer.\n",
            "Like many of Garmin's rugged GPS watches, the Vivosmart 5 uses a combination of a touchscreen and a physical button.\n",
            "That means you can swipe when it makes sense, like scrolling through menus.\n",
            "It also means you can reliably use the button to head back to the home screen and previous menus, as well as stop an activity.\n",
            "It's intuitive to use and eliminates practically all the frustrations I've had with previous Vivosmart models.\n",
            "Also, it's more satisfying to press a button and feel that tactile click.\n",
            "The capacitive buttons on other fitness trackers just don't feel as natural.\n",
            "Another big change is you can finally swap bands to better fit your style.\n",
            "Huzzah!\n",
            "One of the Vivosmart 4's biggest flaws was that it had a unibody design.\n",
            "So while it may have been stylish, it meant you had to truly commit to what model you wanted at checkout.\n",
            "Swappable bands allow for more flexibility, and I appreciated how simple it was to pop the tracker in and out.\n",
            "No finicky pins here.\n",
            "The downside is you have to use Garmin's official accessories at the moment — and the selection there is limited.\n",
            "That doesn't mean Garmin or third parties won't come out with additional options down the line, but it's something to keep in mind.\n",
            "Otherwise, if you liked the Vivosmart 4, the Vivosmart 5 will feel familiar.\n",
            "Instead of completely overhauling the design, Garmin tweaked the overall vibe.\n",
            "Where its predecessor was elegantly chic, the Vivosmart 5 is casually sporty.\n",
            "It's reminiscent of what Garmin did with the Vivomove Sport, which went from a sophisticated luxe look to one that I'd describe as fashionable athleisure.\n",
            "Most importantly, it's still lightweight and comfortable to wear 24/7.\n",
            "The Vivosmart 5 also doesn't add features we haven't already seen.\n",
            "You still get connected GPS through your phone, blood oxygen monitoring, and continuous heart rate monitoring.\n",
            "You can also access Garmin-specific metrics like Body Battery, which helps you visualize how much energy you have for exercise based on your sleep quality and activity levels.\n",
            "This — plus basic smart features like push notifications, timers, and media controls — were all available on the Vivosmart 4.\n",
            "The same holds true for health features like sleep tracking, stress tracking, breathing exercises, and high/low heart rate notifications.\n",
            "The main thing this tracker has over its predecessor is Garmin's safety features.\n",
            "That includes the company's take on fall detection, the ability to let trusted contacts track you in real-time during an activity, and emergency SOS alerts.\n",
            "Instead of adding sensors, the Vivosmart 5 actually gets rid of one: the barometric altimeter.\n",
            "That said, it's not a huge loss.\n",
            "All that means is you can't track floors climbed, and in my experience, this is a notoriously inaccurate metric and not helpful for the average person.\n",
            "Otherwise, you have your standard mix of accelerometers, an SpO2 sensor, an ambient light sensor, and an optical heart rate sensor.\n",
            "Most of the changes Garmin made are smart choices.\n",
            "That said, I have mixed feelings about the monochrome OLED display.\n",
            "It's 66 percent larger this time around, and yes, that does help with readability.\n",
            "It just may not be enough.\n",
            "I happen to be someone cursed with severe astigmatism, and although I have corrective lenses, it's still difficult for me to read small text.\n",
            "Often, I ended up squinting at the display, especially when running outside in bright sunlight.\n",
            "It's not a dealbreaker, per se.\n",
            "It works fine for quickly screening notifications.\n",
            "It's inadequate, however, if you're someone who wants to read full text messages from the wrist.\n",
            "A few years ago, this wouldn't have bothered me as much because almost every fitness band had this type of display.\n",
            "It was just something you dealt with if you preferred this form factor over a smartwatch.\n",
            "However, in 2022, many fitness bands have moved onto color OLED touchscreens.\n",
            "Color displays on fitness bands tend to be much brighter, easier to read, and a better choice for someone like me.\n",
            "I get that not everyone needs or even wants this type of display but it's hard to reconcile when you compare the Vivosmart 5 to the Fitbit Luxe.\n",
            "They have similar sensors, features, design sensibilities, and target audiences.\n",
            "For fitness tracking, the Vivosmart 5 is best for casual activity.\n",
            "It's good for counting steps and how many minutes of intense activity you get per week.\n",
            "If all you want is a rough log of your physical exercise and don't care to get too into the weeds with data, the Vivosmart 5 more than suffices.\n",
            "It's also a good device for folks who feel they're committed enough to stick with an outdoor sport like running or cycling for a long time.\n",
            "Compared to Fitbit, the Garmin Connect app provides much more in-depth metrics (i.e., estimated sweat loss, moving pace versus average pace, etc.)\n",
            "— many of which beginners don't really need but could become helpful insights as someone progresses over time.\n",
            "It's also a decent tracker for outdoor GPS activities.\n",
            "For starters, it never takes too long for the Vivosmart 5 to connect to my phone's GPS — though occasionally you do have to help it along and open the Garmin Connect app.\n",
            "I was also satisfied with its distance tracking.\n",
            "Sometimes with trackers that rely on connected GPS, you end up with wonky results that make it difficult to gauge your progress over time.\n",
            "That wasn't the case with the Vivosmart 5.\n",
            "On an easy two-mile run logged in the Runkeeper app, it recorded 2.09 miles compared to the 2.0 miles logged by my Apple Watch Series 7.\n",
            "This is the sort of discrepancy I expect to see between these three tracking methods at this distance.\n",
            "Both the Vivosmart 5 and Series 7's metrics were also on par when it came to average heart rate and step cadence.\n",

            "It was a chic yet capable fitness band, with a great set of fitness tracking features for the price.\n",
            "It was almost perfect, except for one major flaw: the touchscreen.\n",
            "Swipes didn't register like they were supposed to, and the capacitive button was even more finicky.\n",
            "There, at the bottom of the display, was a beautiful, physical button.\n",
            "Adding a button might not seem like a game-changer, but in this case, it most certainly is.\n",
            "The Vivosmart lineup has always been plagued by unresponsive touchscreens.\n",
            "Sure, the Vivosmart 4 was an improvement on the Vivosmart 3, but it was still frustrating to use.\n",
            "Swipes wouldn't register properly, and sometimes you ended up smacking your wrist just to start an activity.\n",
            "It's the sort of annoyance that builds up over time until one day you just leave an otherwise excellent tracker to collect dust in a drawer.\n",
            "Like many of Garmin's rugged GPS watches, the Vivosmart 5 uses a combination of a touchscreen and a physical button.\n",
            "That means you can swipe when it makes sense, like scrolling through menus.\n",
            "It also means you can reliably use the button to head back to the home screen and previous menus, as well as stop an activity.\n",
            "It's intuitive to use and eliminates practically all the frustrations I've had with previous Vivosmart models.\n",
            "Also, it's more satisfying to press a button and feel that tactile click.\n",
            "The capacitive buttons on other fitness trackers just don't feel as natural.\n",
            "Another big change is you can finally swap bands to better fit your style.\n",
            "Huzzah!\n",
            "One of the Vivosmart 4's biggest flaws was that it had a unibody design.\n",
            "So while it may have been stylish, it meant you had to truly commit to what model you wanted at checkout.\n",
            "Swappable bands allow for more flexibility, and I appreciated how simple it was to pop the tracker in and out.\n",
            "No finicky pins here.\n",
            "The downside is you have to use Garmin's official accessories at the moment — and the selection there is limited.\n",
            "That doesn't mean Garmin or third parties won't come out with additional options down the line, but it's something to keep in mind.\n",
            "Otherwise, if you liked the Vivosmart 4, the Vivosmart 5 will feel familiar.\n",
            "Instead of completely overhauling the design, Garmin tweaked the overall vibe.\n",
            "Where its predecessor was elegantly chic, the Vivosmart 5 is casually sporty.\n",
            "It's reminiscent of what Garmin did with the Vivomove Sport, which went from a sophisticated luxe look to one that I'd describe as fashionable athleisure.\n",
            "Most importantly, it's still lightweight and comfortable to wear 24/7.\n",
            "The Vivosmart 5 also doesn't add features we haven't already seen.\n",
            "You still get connected GPS through your phone, blood oxygen monitoring, and continuous heart rate monitoring.\n",
            "You can also access Garmin-specific metrics like Body Battery, which helps you visualize how much energy you have for exercise based on your sleep quality and activity levels.\n",
            "This — plus basic smart features like push notifications, timers, and media controls — were all available on the Vivosmart 4.\n",
            "The same holds true for health features like sleep tracking, stress tracking, breathing exercises, and high/low heart rate notifications.\n",
            "The main thing this tracker has over its predecessor is Garmin's safety features.\n",
            "That includes the company's take on fall detection, the ability to let trusted contacts track you in real-time during an activity, and emergency SOS alerts.\n",
            "Instead of adding sensors, the Vivosmart 5 actually gets rid of one: the barometric altimeter.\n",
            "That said, it's not a huge loss.\n",
            "All that means is you can't track floors climbed, and in my experience, this is a notoriously inaccurate metric and not helpful for the average person.\n",
            "Otherwise, you have your standard mix of accelerometers, an SpO2 sensor, an ambient light sensor, and an optical heart rate sensor.\n",
            "Most of the changes Garmin made are smart choices.\n",
            "That said, I have mixed feelings about the monochrome OLED display.\n",
            "It's 66 percent larger this time around, and yes, that does help with readability.\n",
            "It just may not be enough.\n",
            "I happen to be someone cursed with severe astigmatism, and although I have corrective lenses, it's still difficult for me to read small text.\n",
            "Often, I ended up squinting at the display, especially when running outside in bright sunlight.\n",
            "It's not a dealbreaker, per se.\n",
            "It works fine for quickly screening notifications.\n",
            "It's inadequate, however, if you're someone who wants to read full text messages from the wrist.\n",
            "A few years ago, this wouldn't have bothered me as much because almost every fitness band had this type of display.\n",
            "It was just something you dealt with if you preferred this form factor over a smartwatch.\n",
            "However, in 2022, many fitness bands have moved onto color OLED touchscreens.\n",
            "Color displays on fitness bands tend to be much brighter, easier to read, and a better choice for someone like me.\n",
            "I get that not everyone needs or even wants this type of display but it's hard to reconcile when you compare the Vivosmart 5 to the Fitbit Luxe.\n",
            "They have similar sensors, features, design sensibilities, and target audiences.\n",
            "For fitness tracking, the Vivosmart 5 is best for casual activity.\n",
            "It's good for counting steps and how many minutes of intense activity you get per week.\n",
            "If all you want is a rough log of your physical exercise and don't care to get too into the weeds with data, the Vivosmart 5 more than suffices.\n",
            "It's also a good device for folks who feel they're committed enough to stick with an outdoor sport like running or cycling for a long time.\n",
            "Compared to Fitbit, the Garmin Connect app provides much more in-depth metrics (i.e., estimated sweat loss, moving pace versus average pace, etc.)\n",
            "— many of which beginners don't really need but could become helpful insights as someone progresses over time.\n",
            "It's also a decent tracker for outdoor GPS activities.\n",
            "For starters, it never takes too long for the Vivosmart 5 to connect to my phone's GPS — though occasionally you do have to help it along and open the Garmin Connect app.\n",
            "I was also satisfied with its distance tracking.\n",
            "Sometimes with trackers that rely on connected GPS, you end up with wonky results that make it difficult to gauge your progress over time.\n",
            "That wasn't the case with the Vivosmart 5.\n",
            "On an easy two-mile run logged in the Runkeeper app, it recorded 2.09 miles compared to the 2.0 miles logged by my Apple Watch Series 7.\n",
            "This is the sort of discrepancy I expect to see between these three tracking methods at this distance.\n",
            "Both the Vivosmart 5 and Series 7's metrics were also on par when it came to average heart rate and step cadence.\n",
            "The trickier thing about trackers with connected GPS is that negligible differences on short runs tend to balloon the longer you go.\n",
            "For instance, I run-walked 2.3 miles with a friend and the Vivosmart 5 logged it as 2.43 miles to the 2.3 miles logged by the Series 7.\n",
            "A 0.13-mile difference isn't so bad if you're not running for long, but these gaps on tethered GPS trackers tend to widen over a longer distance.\n",

            "Don't confuse the Moto G Stylus 5G (2022 edition) with last year's Moto G Stylus 5G or this year's non-5G Moto G Stylus (2022).\n",
            "Somehow, these are all distinctly different phones.\n",
            "While the previous Moto G Stylus 5G wasn't much of a step up spec-wise from last year's 4G-only G Stylus, it's a different story this year.\n",
            "This time around, the G Stylus 5G includes an upgraded Qualcomm chipset, a stabilized main camera, and more RAM.\n",
            "It's more of a Galaxy Note Light rather than an inexpensive phone that happens to have a stylus tucked inside.\n",
            "The G Stylus 5G features a huge 6.8-inch screen with good-enough 1080p resolution and a fast 120Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "Scrolling and animations look smooth as a result, and the phone does use that top 120Hz rate fairly often in auto mode, which is easier on battery life than leaving 120Hz enabled at all times.\n",
            "This screen is an LCD, so blacks are not as dark, and contrast isn't as rich as on an OLED.\n",
            "Video playback quality is fine but not as nice of an experience as you'll get with a more expensive device (or even some other budget and midrange models that now have OLED screens).\n",
            "What bothered me more was that the screen is hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight — in theory, LCD technology has an advantage over OLED in bright conditions.\n",
            "This wasn't the case with the G Stylus 5G, as I squinted at the screen in bright daylight.\n",
            "Indoors, I usually had screen brightness cranked up to 80 or 90 percent, which is all to say that this screen isn't the very brightest.\n",
            "That massive screen makes the phone look a little ridiculous in the side pocket of a pair of yoga pants, but it's just the right size for all of the device's stylus-centric features.\n",
            "Pop the stylus out of its built-in silo, and you'll see a shortcut menu pop up with icons leading you to Motorola's note-taking app, GIF-maker, and coloring book app, among others.\n",
            "A stylus isn't necessarily essential for any of these, but the added accuracy helps.\n",
            "The note app is a bit simpler than what you'll find on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.\n",
            "Rather than giving you access to all of the tools all at once, individual notes have separate tabs for doodling, text entry, images, and voice memos.\n",
            "It's more limited, but it's also less overwhelming.\n",
            "You can choose from a few different background options for your digital page, like a pastel blue with grid lines or a soft gray with dots.\n",
            "They're inviting the way a new, blank journal is.\n",
            "Outside of the notes app, the stylus plays more of a supporting role.\n",
            "You can use it to crop images in a freeform style, add handwriting to a screengrab, or fill in some Disney character-esque coloring book templates.\n",
            "It's a capacitive stylus, so there's no pressure sensitivity, and it lacks the connected features of Samsung's S Pen, like gesture-based Air Actions to control certain functions without touching the screen.\n",
            "Still, there's a little bit of weight to it, and it feels precise and responsive enough for note-taking and sketches.\n",
            "Overall phone performance is very good.\n",
            "The Snapdragon 695 is a cut above the 400-series chipset used by last year's model, and the unlocked version of the phone includes a very healthy 8GB of RAM.\n",
            "There are ways in which I can definitely see all of that power at work: apps stay open for a relatively long time in the background, and I can run a very graphics-heavy game like Genshin Impact fairly smoothly.\n",
            "Performance isn't flawless; some apps, like the camera app, are a little slow to open on initial startup.\n",
            "Battery stamina is healthy, too.\n",
            "Some of Motorola's budget phones will truly run for days on a single charge if you're a light or moderate user — the G Stylus 5G isn't quite on that level, but it will get most users safely through a full day of use.\n",
            "Even on a day of heavy use, I was still at 20 percent by bedtime.\n",
            "Battery life isn't exceptional, but it shouldn't be something that owners of the device will need to worry about.\n",
            "A quick word on 5G: the unlocked version of the phone can use Verizon and T-Mobile's sub-6GHz 5G networks, and Motorola spokesperson Stephanie Stiltz says that other carriers will be available “in the coming months.” Presumably, that means AT&T.\n",
            "The G Stylus 5G supports the n77 C-band frequency that Verizon and AT&T are using to upgrade their long-range 5G networks, so it should be able to take advantage of it when more of that spectrum comes online over the next couple of years.\n",
            "The Moto G Stylus 5G ships with Android 12 installed, as it should because Android 13 is coming just around the corner.\n",
            "Motorola's implementation of Android remains one of my favorites, including the “peek” notifications on the lock screen that are useful without being disruptive.\n",
            "The system will prompt you to opt into a suggested app feature on the home screen powered by a company called Branch.\n",
            "In my testing, its suggestions aren't all that smart, and it just takes up space, but it's easy enough to just not opt in to that particular feature.\n",
            "Motorola's Stiltz says that the G Stylus 5G will get one OS platform upgrade and three years of security updates.\n",
            "That's an improvement over the company's previous policy of supporting phones for two years, though not as good as Samsung's five-year policy for some of its budget phones, like the Galaxy A53 5G.\n",

            "This time around, the G Stylus 5G includes an upgraded Qualcomm chipset, a stabilized main camera, and more RAM.\n",
            "It's more of a Galaxy Note Light rather than an inexpensive phone that happens to have a stylus tucked inside.\n",
            "The G Stylus 5G features a huge 6.8-inch screen with good-enough 1080p resolution and a fast 120Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "Scrolling and animations look smooth as a result, and the phone does use that top 120Hz rate fairly often in auto mode, which is easier on battery life than leaving 120Hz enabled at all times.\n",
            "This screen is an LCD, so blacks are not as dark, and contrast isn't as rich as on an OLED.\n",
            "Video playback quality is fine but not as nice of an experience as you'll get with a more expensive device (or even some other budget and midrange models that now have OLED screens).\n",
            "What bothered me more was that the screen is hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight — in theory, LCD technology has an advantage over OLED in bright conditions.\n",
            "This wasn't the case with the G Stylus 5G, as I squinted at the screen in bright daylight.\n",
            "Indoors, I usually had screen brightness cranked up to 80 or 90 percent, which is all to say that this screen isn't the very brightest.\n",
            "That massive screen makes the phone look a little ridiculous in the side pocket of a pair of yoga pants, but it's just the right size for all of the device's stylus-centric features.\n",
            "Pop the stylus out of its built-in silo, and you'll see a shortcut menu pop up with icons leading you to Motorola's note-taking app, GIF-maker, and coloring book app, among others.\n",
            "A stylus isn't necessarily essential for any of these, but the added accuracy helps.\n",
            "The note app is a bit simpler than what you'll find on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.\n",
            "Rather than giving you access to all of the tools all at once, individual notes have separate tabs for doodling, text entry, images, and voice memos.\n",

            "It's a capacitive stylus, so there's no pressure sensitivity, and it lacks the connected features of Samsung's S Pen, like gesture-based Air Actions to control certain functions without touching the screen.\n",
            "Still, there's a little bit of weight to it, and it feels precise and responsive enough for note-taking and sketches.\n",
            "Overall phone performance is very good.\n",
            "The Snapdragon 695 is a cut above the 400-series chipset used by last year's model, and the unlocked version of the phone includes a very healthy 8GB of RAM.\n",
            "There are ways in which I can definitely see all of that power at work: apps stay open for a relatively long time in the background, and I can run a very graphics-heavy game like Genshin Impact fairly smoothly.\n",
            "Performance isn't flawless; some apps, like the camera app, are a little slow to open on initial startup.\n",
            "Battery stamina is healthy, too.\n",
            "Some of Motorola's budget phones will truly run for days on a single charge if you're a light or moderate user — the G Stylus 5G isn't quite on that level, but it will get most users safely through a full day of use.\n",
            "Even on a day of heavy use, I was still at 20 percent by bedtime.\n",
            "Battery life isn't exceptional, but it shouldn't be something that owners of the device will need to worry about.\n",
            "A quick word on 5G: the unlocked version of the phone can use Verizon and T-Mobile's sub-6GHz 5G networks, and Motorola spokesperson Stephanie Stiltz says that other carriers will be available “in the coming months.” Presumably, that means AT&T.\n",
            "The G Stylus 5G supports the n77 C-band frequency that Verizon and AT&T are using to upgrade their long-range 5G networks, so it should be able to take advantage of it when more of that spectrum comes online over the next couple of years.\n",
            "The Moto G Stylus 5G ships with Android 12 installed, as it should because Android 13 is coming just around the corner.\n",

            "The system will prompt you to opt into a suggested app feature on the home screen powered by a company called Branch.\n",
            "In my testing, its suggestions aren't all that smart, and it just takes up space, but it's easy enough to just not opt in to that particular feature.\n",
            "Motorola's Stiltz says that the G Stylus 5G will get one OS platform upgrade and three years of security updates.\n",

            "The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 from last year was a sharp laptop that stumbled a bit in terms of performance thanks largely to its Intel CPU.\n",
            "While the lightweight form factor was a plus, we were ultimately disappointed with the overall performance offered by this laptop, especially given its high price point.\n",
            "Asus clearly isn't attempting to reinvent the wheel this year, offering another Intel-based laptop that retains much of what worked with its predecessor while smoothing out some of the rough edges.\n",
            "Many of these additions are welcome but mostly iterative, offering faster 12th Gen Intel CPUs and up to an RTX 3080 Ti graphics card.\n",
            "However, I'm more interested to see if the M16 earned its higher price tag this time around.\n",
            "It's also worth mentioning that if you're in the market for a gaming laptop, the 2022 version of the Asus Zephyrus G15 added a webcam to its already impressive list of specs, addressing one of the biggest issues we had with the prior model and removing one of the big advantages the M16 had over the G15.\n",
            "However, the Intel processor in the M16 has the potential to give it an edge in creative applications.\n",
            "This year's model of the M16 is all about Alder Lake.\n",
            "The model I tested was equipped with a Core i9-12900H paired with an Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti backed up by 2TB of storage and 16GB of DDR5 RAM.\n",
            "With more configuration options and a budget model with a price that's a little more accessible, it feels like Asus is at least on the right track in terms of pricing.\n",
            "Even among competitors like the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro and the Razer Blade 15, you'll be hard-pressed to find a laptop that's less expensive but can match the specs of the M16 pound for pound.\n",
            "The latest model of the Razer Blade 15 is a similar case, with a 3070 Ti, the same amount of RAM and storage, and a slightly less powerful CPU.\n",
            "So far, the specs of the M16 are mostly what we'd expect, but the inclusion of an integrated Intel Iris Xe GPU and a multiplexer or MUX switch separate this laptop from its predecessor and other gaming options.\n",
            "These additions to the M16 motherboard go hand in hand, allowing the laptop to dynamically switch between its dedicated and integrated GPU based on usage to optimize battery life without sacrificing performance.\n",
            "Battery life was a bit of a pain point with the older M16, which only averaged about six hours of general use on a single charge.\n",
            "This year's M16 thankfully displays at least a marginal improvement.\n",
            "I was able to get an average of two hours while playing Destiny 2 on high settings and about six hours of general use with the standard power profile.\n",
            "In practice, the MUX switch had a marked impact on the longevity of this laptop, letting it run roughly three times longer than it would if it relied solely on a discrete GPU.\n",
            "A seven-hour battery life isn't bad in the realm of gaming laptops (at least ones with Intel chips), but I wouldn't recommend taking the M16 very far from an outlet.\n",
            "One aspect we liked about the previous model of the M16 was the display, which remains relatively unchanged.\n",
            "The thin bezel screen ensures that no screen space is wasted in this 16-inch chassis.\n",
            "With a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1600 and a 165Hz refresh rate, this isn't the fastest or highest resolution display you can get on a laptop by any stretch, but this strikes a happy medium that allows the M16 to get the most out of its hardware without wasting potential.\n",
            "In terms of performance, the M16 can easily handle a variety of modern titles at its native resolution with all the sliders turned up, which includes ray tracing and v-sync.\n",
            "Shadow of the Tomb Raider struggled a little with RTX shadows maxed out, but still averaged a little under 60fps whereas Doom Eternal was able to manage well over 90fps with all settings on “ultra nightmare.” The only benchmark that tripped up the M16 was Red Dead Redemption 2, which maintained an average of 45fps but occasionally dipped below 30.\n",
            "However, with DLSS enabled on blanched mode, RDR2 performed far better, managing a remarkably smooth 60fps.\n",
            "I also tested less graphically demanding titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to see how far I could push the 165Hz display, which the M16 also handled quite well — only dipping below 165fps on a small handful of occasions.\n",
            "The M16 even managed to push a maximum of 340fps at times without vertical sync or a frame limiter enabled, far faster than what the display is even capable of rendering.\n",
            "These numbers represent a marked improvement over the previous model of the M16, which maxed out at 236fps during our benchmark of CS:GO, and around 38fps in our test with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on ultra settings.\n",
            "The RDR2 benchmark for the older M16 wasn't much different, however, averaging 42fps with everything set to maximum.\n",
            "With these previous examples, it should go without saying, but games on the M16 display look amazing.\n",
            "The 2560 x 1600 resolution offers great fidelity, while features like Dolby Vision and HDR10 provide excellent depth of color.\n",
            "Additionally, the 500 nits of peak brightness also ensure that you don't miss a single detail and do a commendable job of combating glare.\n",
            "The M16 can handle games well enough, but I had hoped that the presence of Intel silicon would provide a boost in terms of productivity performance as well.\n",
            "Running the hardware against the Puget Systems benchmark tests for DaVinci and Adobe Premiere Pro, I wasn't disappointed.\n",
            "The final overall scores were 1243 and 1047, respectively.\n",
            "One anomaly I did encounter was in regard to our video export test, which regularly took over seven minutes to complete with the best time clocking in at 7:43.\n",
            "Other laptops with comparable hardware, even ones made by Asus, managed to complete the same task in closer to three minutes.\n",
            "I ran the benchmark on different versions of Adobe Premiere Pro and made sure the correct power settings were being used with no change in the result.\n",
            "I'm currently unsure whether to chalk this one up to a hardware or software issue, but I've reached out to Asus for comment and will post an update if anything changes.\n",
            "Outside of the anomaly with our export tests, these results put the M16 in performance brackets that are currently occupied by more expensive competitors with similar hardware configurations like the Gigabyte Aorus 17 XE4 and the latest model of the Razer Blade 17.\n",
            "While the performance here outstrips the previous model by a wide margin, the M16 still struggles with the thermal load created by this new hardware.\n",
            "While I didn't experience any throttling while running benchmarks, the temperatures on the CPU for the M16 occasionally spiked to over 90 degrees Celsius.\n",
            "Asus has made some modest improvements to attempt to offset this additional heat, like a different thermal paste and some small changes to the fan blades, but the M16 remains both hot and incredibly loud when under heavy load.\n",
            "However, I should stress that this is when the M16 is using its “turbo” mode, which pushes most of its hardware to the edge of the performance envelope.\n",
            "Thankfully, the M16, like other Zephyrus laptops, allows you to switch performance profiles that trade higher performance for power usage and more audible cooling.\n",
            "The included Armoury Crate software lets you switch between silent, balanced, and turbo modes with the press of a button.\n",
            "However, while on battery power, the M16 is limited to just its silent or balanced profiles.\n",
            "Silent mode is particularly impressive, and while it isn't dead quiet, it's still capable of delivering usable performance without making itself sound like a jet taking off.\n",
            "It was so quiet, in fact, that I was able to play Destiny 2 in my living room without disturbing my partner, who was watching TV just a couple of feet away.\n",
            "This did impact performance, causing occasional dips in the frame rate and some temperature spikes, sometimes reaching as high as 85 degrees Celsius, but barring that, I was astonished at how long this laptop was capable of maintaining that kind of performance without being super audible.\n",
            "A laptop that gets this loud is going to be in constant competition with its speakers, which feel sadly underpowered.\n",
            "The M16 features a total of six speakers this time around, and while they aren't terrible, they aren't great, either.\n",
            "Generally, the sound felt very hollow and was very limited in terms of its presentation.\n",
            "Several times I thought turning up the volume might help, but in most cases, I ended up reaching for a pair of headphones rather than tolerating the lackluster speakers.\n",
            "I even used the Dolby Atmos feature in an effort to fill things out but was still left unimpressed.\n",
            "The 720p webcam makes a return from last year.\n",
            "While it's been proven that a gaming laptop doesn't necessarily need a webcam to be good, it's become one of those features that you just sort of expect from any laptop — especially if you're needing to use it for work or schooling tasks outside of gaming.\n",
            "The quality of the camera here isn't going to blow anyone away but is more than sufficient for Zoom calls.\n",
            "However, the noise-canceling microphone array was surprisingly effective at filtering out unwanted background noise.\n",
            "Regardless of the changes made to the hardware, the chassis of the M16 still looks great.\n",
            "If you've seen a Zephyrus laptop in the past year, the M16 will look familiar.\n",
            "I personally like the aesthetics, especially the reflective highlights on the lid.\n",
            "The Ergolift hinge also makes a welcome return, which lifts the base of the chassis slightly to improve airflow.\n",
            "The matte black finish is sharp-looking, but I was slightly disappointed at how quickly it picked up fingerprints.\n",
            "In terms of size, the M16 measures 14 x 10 x 1 (HWD) and weighs in at just 4.4 pounds.\n",
            "The 240W adapter has some heft to it but isn't cumbersome, making the entire package relatively portable if not particularly light.\n",
            "The similarities continue with the layout of the keyboard and touchpad on the M16, which is virtually identical to some of the previous entries in the Zephyrus lineup with dedicated volume keys and RGB backlighting.\n",
            "The spacious trackpad takes up a 5.1- x 3.4-inch footprint, and while certainly larger than most, didn't feel obtrusive at all.\n",
            "Both the keyboard and trackpad serve up a satisfying click, lending the M16 some excellent haptics whether you're typing or gaming.\n",
            "The chassis also packs some impressive connectivity options.\n",
            "In addition to the more basic dual USB-A and HDMI hookup, it also includes a pair of USB-C ports, one of which is Thunderbolt-compatible (something you don't get on the AMD-equipped G15).\n",
            "There's also a microSD card slot.\n",
            "The laptop can also support a wired ethernet connection and 3.5mm audio cables along with some other nice under the hood improvements, like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity.\n",

            "But for everything else, this OLED panel is just nicer to look at than a mediocre LCD.\n",
            "Colors look a little punchier, and watching video is more enjoyable, especially when it's something with a lot of dimly lit scenes (looking at you, The Batman).\n",
            "I think this is a trade-off a lot of people can appreciate.\n",
            "The screen's 1080p resolution is above average, too, since 720p is more common in the budget class.\n",
            "For a screen this big, you really do need that higher resolution to keep images looking sharp.\n",
            "This isn't the brightest OLED I've used, but it does get bright enough to be usable in direct sunlight.\n",
            "One of the N20's best features is embedded in that display: a fingerprint sensor — a good in-display fingerprint sensor.\n",
            "It's quick and reliable even with wet fingers or outside in bright sunlight.\n",
            "The Nord N20 5G uses a midrange Snapdragon 695 5G chipset, which is a cut above the budget-level 400-series Snapdragons and 700-series MediaTek chips commonly found in this class.\n",
            "It's also paired with 6GB of RAM, another improvement over the 4GB more typical of budget phones.\n",
            "It runs graphics intensive games like Genshin Impact reasonably well (with some noticeable stuttering but nothing that impacted gameplay).\n",
            "In day-to-day use, jumping from app to app is quick, and I'm rarely left waiting for the phone to catch up as I switch from scrolling Instagram to typing an email or taking a picture.\n",
            "I do notice apps closing in the background but not to the point that it's bothersome.\n",
            "Turning high-performance mode on seems to help a bit but doesn't totally solve the problem.\n",
            "There's just one downward firing built-in speaker on the N20 5G, and it's really easy to cover with your finger when holding the phone.\n",
            "It's also just not a good speaker.\n",
            "But you can't have everything on a budget phone, and this seems like a reasonable trade-off.\n",
            "The N20 includes a healthy 128GB of built-in storage, which can be expanded by way of the microSD card slot.\n",
            "There's also a real, live headphone jack on this phone, and it ships with a fast charger in the box.\n",
            "That completes the trifecta of features that are quickly disappearing from flagship and midrange phones but that you can still find in the budget class.\n",
            "The phone supports 33W wired charging with the included charger (but, unsurprisingly, no wireless charging).\n",
            "With the phone powered off and the battery completely depleted, it charged up to 30 percent in a mere 20 minutes.\n",
            "In total, the phone charged from flat to 100 percent in an hour and 15 minutes in my testing — at least 15 minutes faster than the typical budget phone.\n",
            "Most of the time, you can get to a very usable 90 percent much sooner, as charging slows down considerably for the last 10 percent of battery.\n",
            "The N20's 4500mAh battery isn't the biggest in the class, but it does power the phone through a full day of use — even heavy use.\n",
            "With the always-on display and high-performance mode enabled, a mix of Wi-Fi and 5G usage, and some battery-hungry activities mixed in, like downloading and playing 20 minutes of Genshin Impact, I've gotten close to 3.5 hours of screen-on time in the last 24 hours and I'm down to 20 percent battery.\n",
            "Based on those numbers, it's fair to say that the N20 5G will easily get a light or moderate user through a full day of use.\n",
            "Google has started taking its Android 13 beta public, but the N20 5G is still back on Android 11.\n",
            "OnePlus says it will get an update to Android 12, but it couldn't give an estimated timeframe for it.\n",
            "In the meantime, OnePlus' version of Android 11 (and 12 for that matter) is a little more minimalist and a little less whimsical than the Samsung or Google versions.\n",
            "It's easy to navigate, and there are mercifully few pre-downloaded T-Mobile apps.\n",
            "OnePlus says that Android 12 will be the only OS platform upgrade for the N20, which is a bummer with the next OS version right around the corner, and that it's scheduled to receive three years of security updates.\n",
            "Three years of support isn't the worst policy among Android device makers, but it's not the best — that honor would go to Samsung, with four or five years of support depending on the phone.\n",
            "I'd love to see OnePlus commit to additional years of software support for its devices, but three years strikes me as sufficient for a lot of people.\n",
            "When OnePlus introduces an unlocked version of the N20, its story of which 5G bands it supports will get a little more complicated.\n",
            "The n77 C-band frequency, which Verizon and AT&T rely on a lot, isn't on the spec sheet, for example.\n",
            "So if it does get 5G certification on those carriers, it may only be for the slower might-as-well-be-LTE variety.\n",
            "But for now, the story is simple: the N20 5G supports T-Mobile 5G.\n",
            "While Verizon and AT&T are hurrying to build out their mid-band 5G networks (read: the good 5G) T-Mobile got a big head start years ago when it bought Sprint.\n",
            "Long story short: it's really good, and it's good now, not in a year or two.\n",
            "It's been a little while since I used a 5G phone on T-Mobile, and I'm seriously impressed by the speeds I saw both at home and out in my neighborhood around T-Mobile's corporate backyard of Seattle.\n",
            "I've been able to pick up T-Mobile's faster Ultra Capacity 5G signal fairly often, and I get download speeds of 300–500Mbps when I do.\n",
            "For comparison's sake, my home Wi-Fi is around 100Mbps on a good day.\n",
            "All this is to say that the N20 is in great shape to take advantage of a very fast network if you happen to live somewhere with good T-Mobile 5G coverage.\n",
            "There are two large camera modules on the back of the N20 5G, which might lead you to think that there are two important cameras on this phone.\n",
            "There are not.\n",
            "The top camera is a 64-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide, and the module below it is a 2-megapixel macro camera — the same kind of small, low-grade macro camera found on many other budget phones.\n",
            "Its relatively large housing is just window dressing.\n",
            "The third, smaller lens belongs to a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor, which is the only thing more pointless than a tiny macro camera.\n",
            "The good news is that the 64-megapixel main camera is good.\n",
            "Images taken outdoors in good lighting are pleasant; exposures are balanced, and colors look a little warmer than on Google's Pixel phones but less saturated than on Samsung's Galaxy devices.\n",
            "It's a nice sweet spot.\n",
            "I'm impressed with the 2x digital zoom on this camera, too.\n",
            "In good lighting, details are surprisingly sharp.\n",
            "It's not a lot of reach, but it's good enough that I'd use it in a pinch when getting closer to my subject isn't possible.\n",
            "Images taken indoors in less good lighting can look a little artificially bright, as is common with other OnePlus phones.\n",
            "Night mode has a habit of taking this a step further, with color saturation that tends to look artificial.\n",
            "But given the choice, I'd take just about any night mode over no night mode at all.\n",
            "The macro camera is about the same as any other smartphone macro camera: very low res and not very useful.\n",
            "To even enable it, you need to tap “more” in the camera app and pick it out of a grid of options where it's dead last in the third row after “text scanner.” Maybe OnePlus is hoping you won't find it.\n",
            "I wish this camera were an ultrawide instead.\n",
            "As for the monochrome sensor, OnePlus quietly phased it out of its flagship phones, but it's still hanging around here in the budget class.\n",
            "Supposedly, it supplies additional image information when you're shooting in the black-and-white filter mode.\n",
            "Covering the sensor with my finger produces an image that looks exactly the same as with it uncovered.\n",
            "Counting this sensor as the phone's third rear camera is definitely a stretch.\n",
            "Video, as mentioned above, is limited to a maximum resolution of 1080p.\n",
            "That's too bad since 4K has really become the standard for high-resolution video.\n",
            "As it is, the 1080p clips are good, if a little noisy in low light.\n",
            "There's an aggressive crop, but as a trade-off you get some fairly good electronic image stabilization.\n",
            "Swapping out the macro and monochrome sensors with even a mediocre ultrawide would have been a worthwhile exchange in my book; at least an ultrawide is tangibly useful.\n",
            "The main camera does fine in the right lighting conditions.\n",
            "It's just a shame that it's doing all of the legwork on the N20.\n",
            "The OnePlus N20 5G is an excellent deal if — these are important “ifs”: you're on T-Mobile and camera quality isn't your top priority.\n",
            "If so, it's just a pleasure to use.\n",
            "The screen is rich and detailed, performance is good, the fingerprint scanner is quick, and wired charging is seriously fast.\n",
            "In this price bracket, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is more or less the default recommendation.\n",
            "The N20 doesn't quite overtake it, but it's a very worthwhile alternative.\n",
            "The A32 offers an ultrawide in addition to its standard wide camera and shoots 4K video, so it's a better choice if image quality is a priority.\n",
            "It's almost a year old at this point, but it's still scheduled to get three more years of security updates.\n",
            "It's already getting Android 12, too, so it's a step ahead on the software side.\n",
            "But the N20 is a better choice if you're looking for a great screen and a more sophisticated software experience.\n",
            "You'll also get double the built-in storage and 2GB more RAM than the 64GB / 4GB RAM version of the A32 5G sold in the US.\n",
            "We interact with our phones roughly a million times per day, so it's worth making sure the device you pick is one that you enjoy using.\n",
            "Personally, I'd find a way to live without an ultrawide camera and pick the N20 over the A32 just based on its enjoyability factor.\n",
            "It's OnePlus at its finest — delivering an experience that feels like it cost more than it actually did.\n",
            "Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "To use the OnePlus N20 5G, you need to agree to:\n",
            "There are also several optional agreements that you need to get past during setup:\n",
            "On this carrier-locked device, there are three more optional agreements from T-Mobile:\n",
            "In total, that's six mandatory agreements and at least seven optional agreements.\n",
            "The OnePlus Nord N20 5G is OnePlus at its best.\n",
            "While the company hasn't quite mastered the flagship, it has dialed in the recipe for a stellar budget phone.\n",
            "It's not perfect, but it strikes an excellent balance of price and features that makes it easy to recommend — if you're on T-Mobile.\n",
            "That's one of a few “ifs” that makes it difficult to recommend the N20 5G to absolutely anyone looking for a budget Android phone.\n",
            "As it's being introduced in the US, the N20 5G will only be sold through T-Mobile.\n",
            "OnePlus says it plans to sell the phone unlocked at a later date, but a company spokesperson, Spenser Blank, wouldn't offer any comment on whether the company will seek 5G certification on Verizon and AT&T when it does.\n",
            "There's also the fact that OnePlus is being a little disingenuous by saying that the N20 5G offers a triple rear camera array.\n",
            "Sure, there are technically three image sensors back there, but only one of them is worth caring about.\n",
            "There are some minor trade-offs to be aware of, too, like the fact that the phone doesn't shoot 4K video and has a low-grade built-in speaker.\n",
            "But overall phone performance is a strength, along with a good OLED screen in a category stacked with mediocre LCD panels.\n",
            "Those are important things to get right, and the N20 does just that.\n",
            "One of the N20 5G's standout specs is its 6.43-inch 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "More expensive phones offer contrast-rich OLEDs and faster refresh rates, but a budget phone can't have both — at least not right now.\n",
            "While other manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola have opted for lower-contrast LCDs that offer higher 90Hz refresh rates, OnePlus went the other way with the N20 and skipped the fast refresh rate to offer an OLED.\n",

            "If you already know that games install into the app drawer on Android by default, it can feel like relearning an unnecessarily obtuse way to access your content.\n",

            "It's helpful that Xiaomi includes a tutorial for using the software, even if it's all but required due to the added complexity of having so many features.\n",
            "In it, there are toggles that let you take advantage of this phone's many impressive specs, like its 720Hz touch sampling rate, or a “Ludicrous Mode,” that pushes the specs to their limit.\n",

            "Xiaomi should have stopped there because Shark Chan has a few other features that are just plain off-putting.\n",
            "I did a double-take when I noticed that the software includes a mention of Shark Chan's bust, waist, and hip measurements, as if I'm playing a dating sim.\n",
            "There's also a gallery mode where it wants you to touch Shark Chan's avatar.\n",
            "It'll respond with dismissive or bashful responses depending on where you touch it, calling you “commander” with each line.\n",

            "And, at this point, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 within the S22 series outpaces the Snapdragon 888 that's in the 4 Pro.\n",

            "It's compatible with a smattering of bands for AT&T and T-Mobile, but it's not broad support in the slightest.\n",
            "The Black Shark's mechanical triggers are a neat idea, though it's a feature that I'm far less likely to rely on than connecting something affordable, like a Razer Kishi that adds console-like controls to your phone (including USB-C passthrough) or even a DualSense controller connected wirelessly via Bluetooth.\n",

            "They're proofs of concept that you can get laptop-tier specs into a pocket-sized device.\n",
            "If only a company made a device with more focused software that doesn't feel so pressured to lean (in Black Shark's case, very awkwardly) into the stereotypical lane of what it thinks a gamer wants in phone software.\n",
            "It's really not a good look.\n",
            "For all of the power and high-end tech that's bundled in gaming phones, they aren't great all-around picks for people who want great software, boundary-pushing cameras, and a more appealing device around the edges.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",

            "Along its right edge, there are two switches that, when toggled, make small button-like triggers sprout from the phone.\n",
            "Whereas many previous gaming phones have relied on invisible ultrasonic touch sensors (that do a surprisingly good job of mimicking the real thing), these have, well, something closer to the real thing.\n",
            "The travel is vastly shorter than triggers that you'd find on controllers, but they're satisfyingly clicky.\n",
            "Beyond in-game use, the switches are some of the most fidget-friendly mechanisms that I've used in years.\n",
            "Similarly satisfying is this device's haptics, which provide the punchiest, perfectly delineated blips of vibration that I've ever felt on an Android phone.\n",
            "The hardware is, arguably, the only great thing about this phone.\n",
            "Almost everything else about using this phone matches the ho-hum experience that I've had with other gaming phones.\n",
            "It uses JOYUI12 (based on Xiaomi's MIUI12 twist on Android 11), and at the beating heart of the experience is a gaming dashboard app called Shark Space that acts as a home base for launching games from, tweaking overclock settings, and more.\n",
            "If you already know that games install into the app drawer on Android by default, it can feel like relearning an unnecessarily obtuse way to access your content.\n",
            "I'm used to gaming phones having some odd touches to their software to match the maximalist approach to hardware design, but this Black Shark phone takes the cake with its built-in “Shark Chan” app.\n",
            "Shark Chan looks like an anime character ripped out of Genshin Impact, with a scantily clad look that leans all the way into being male-gazey.\n",
            "It's essentially a busty Clippy, and its responsibility is to walk you through the phone's mind-bogglingly numerous UI elements that can be accessed in-game with a diagonal swipe down from the right corner of the screen while in landscape mode.\n",
            "It's helpful that Xiaomi includes a tutorial for using the software, even if it's all but required due to the added complexity of having so many features.\n",
            "In it, there are toggles that let you take advantage of this phone's many impressive specs, like its 720Hz touch sampling rate, or a “Ludicrous Mode,” that pushes the specs to their limit.\n",
            "(It suggests that you buy an accessory to help keep the phone cool while this mode is active).\n",
            "Beyond being where you can adjust settings, Shark Chan can be a virtual butler, of sorts, offering congratulations for charging the phone and nagging you when an alarm goes off.\n",
            "Xiaomi should have stopped there because Shark Chan has a few other features that are just plain off-putting.\n",
            "I did a double-take when I noticed that the software includes a mention of Shark Chan's bust, waist, and hip measurements, as if I'm playing a dating sim.\n",
            "There's also a gallery mode where it wants you to touch Shark Chan's avatar.\n",
            "It'll respond with dismissive or bashful responses depending on where you touch it, calling you “commander” with each line.\n",
            "I didn't want or need a weird attempt at a dating sim meshed with a virtual assistant, and I'm not sure why Xiaomi thought that this would be a good idea.\n",
            "I'd be willing to overlook some of these shortcomings if there weren't already other powerful phones on the market.\n",
            "Samsung's latest Galaxy S22 lineup, for instance, packs a lot of power as well as a 240Hz touch sampling rate.\n",
            "That's a fraction of the Black Shark 4 Pro's 720Hz spec, but I'd argue that the tangible difference probably isn't perceptible to most people.\n",
            "And, at this point, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 within the S22 series outpaces the Snapdragon 888 that's in the 4 Pro.\n",
            "You can have most of the power that you need in a phone that looks far better than this one and works with many more US carriers.\n",
            "The Black Shark 4 Pro won't work with LTE or 5G networks on most carriers — at least reliably.\n",
            "It's compatible with a smattering of bands for AT&T and T-Mobile, but it's not broad support in the slightest.\n",
            "The Black Shark's mechanical triggers are a neat idea, though it's a feature that I'm far less likely to rely on than connecting something affordable, like a Razer Kishi that adds console-like controls to your phone (including USB-C passthrough) or even a DualSense controller connected wirelessly via Bluetooth.\n",
            "If you're using an iPhone, you should get the excellent Backbone One controller to attach to your phone.\n",
            "To each their own, though.\n",
            "I recognize that there's an audience of mobile gamers who rely solely on touch controls.\n",
            "And for that one key area, gaming phones like this one can't be beaten.\n",
            "At the core, there's nothing wrong with the concept of gaming phones.\n",
            "They're thicker than your average flagship phone due to bigger batteries, a heat sink, and several other components that you probably won't find in phones made by Google, Apple, or Samsung.\n",
            "They're proofs of concept that you can get laptop-tier specs into a pocket-sized device.\n",
            "If only a company made a device with more focused software that doesn't feel so pressured to lean (in Black Shark's case, very awkwardly) into the stereotypical lane of what it thinks a gamer wants in phone software.\n",
            "It's really not a good look.\n",
            "For all of the power and high-end tech that's bundled in gaming phones, they aren't great all-around picks for people who want great software, boundary-pushing cameras, and a more appealing device around the edges.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "To actually use the Black Shark 4 Pro, you must accept several agreements:\n",
            "You'll have the option to agree to the following steps:\n",
            "In total, you have to accept nine agreements and can bypass 12 when setting up the Black Shark 4 Pro.\n",

            "The Verge asks each company whose smart home products we review about safeguards it has in place for your data.\n",
            "The primary home data a robot vacuum like Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni manages are the maps it generates and video and image data from its onboard camera.\n",
            "In addition, the Yiko voice assistant uses onboard speakers and microphones.\n",
            "Yiko voice recordings are stored locally on the device, but Ecovacs says these will move to servers later this year with user opt-in.\n",
            "The X1 hardware and apps have obtained the TÜV Rheinland privacy and security certification, whose requirements include passwords, secure storage, secure communication, and software updates.\n",
            "Map data is stored locally on the device and can be cleared with a factory reset.\n",

            "In terms of a robot vacuum, the X1 Omni has all the high-end specs you'd expect: AI obstacle avoidance so it doesn't get tripped up by stray cables and socks; lidar navigation and mapping; 5,000 Pa of suction power; and a 5,200mAh battery that promises over four hours of cleaning on quiet mode.\n",
            "In testing, it never ran out of juice on standard mode when cleaning my 400-square-foot main floor, but when I pumped up the power to max suction and high water flow with two passes, it had to go back to charge after 70 minutes.\n",
            "You control the robot with the Ecovacs Home app, which has digital keep-out zones to keep the bot away from tricky or sensitive areas, room-specific and customized cleaning (so you can have the kitchen double mopped and the hallway vacuumed on max power but just lightly clean the dining room), four vacuuming modes, and three mopping modes.\n",
            "All this is in addition to the built-in voice assistant and security camera feature.\n",
            "It's a lot.\n",
            "And I'm not convinced that we need to throw the kitchen sink at the challenge of cleaning our floors (this model literally has a sink inside it for washing the mops).\n",
            "The phrase “too many cooks” is apt here, primarily because the X1 Omni software is not always up to all the tasks the hardware demands.\n",
            "It has AI-powered obstacle avoidance but was tripped up once by my fake dog turds (made from putty).\n",
            "While it ably avoided cables and shoes and other large objects, it also decided a smattering of Cocoa Krispies cereal and a gum wrapper should be avoided.\n",
            "The X1 navigated expertly around furniture, getting in between my kitchen stools and dining table chair legs without knocking anything over, but its 3-D mapping technology that should identify all my furniture automatically (so I can ask it to go clean around the couch) only found one piece of furniture in my house.\n",
            "You can add furniture manually in the Ecovacs app, but the X1 went through a phase of refusing to use the carefully crafted map on which I'd added keep-out zones and furniture, and instead created a new one on each run.\n",
            "I eventually fixed this by deleting all the maps and sending it out on another quick mapping run (which it did in under two minutes, faster than most lidar mapping robots that take five or six minutes to get my floorplan down).\n",
            "This time the map stuck, but it hasn't identified any more furniture and I'm reticent to put all that work in, in case it deletes it again.\n",
            "Software niggles aside, the X1's hardware is impressive, and this is a good-looking robot vacuum, a rarity in this space.\n",
            "Ecovacs tasked Danish firm Jacob Jensen Design (of Bang & Olufsen fame) to dream up this sleek, modern-looking robot and base.\n",
            "While the whole package is enormous (the base is two feet high and over a foot deep), it looks much better than Roborock's utilitarian auto empty, wash, and fill dock, and it does far more than iRobot's elegant auto-empty base for its j7 robot vacuum.\n",
            "Ecovacs' automatic Omni Station hides all the utilitarian features of this home cleaning robot inside a polished silver and matte black case.\n",
            "It packs in two removable, four-liter water tanks (one for dirty water, one for clean), a pop-out drawer for the dust bag, and a nice little cubby for the robot to hide in, tucking it away more discreetly than most charging docks.\n",
            "It looks good enough that you won't feel the need to hide this away, although you may struggle to find a home for it since it is so big.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is an excellent robot mop.\n",
            "Instead of the thin scrap of cloth you find on most mopping vacuums, it has two thick mopping pads that spin at 180 RPM.\n",
            "However, they have to be removed if you want to vacuum rugs or carpet, as the robot has rug-avoidance tech that stops it from dragging wet cloths over your carpet.\n",
            "You need to flip the entire robot over to install or uninstall them, and there's no storage spot for them in the giant Omni base.\n",
            "But the two pads look impressive as they do their spinning thing.\n",
            "While it mops much better than most hybrid mop/vacs, it wasn't any more effective at mopping than the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra.\n",
            "Both do excellent jobs of tackling light spills and cleaning up fine debris the vacuum missed, but neither can handle tougher jobs like ketchup or dried-up milk.\n",
            "You also can't add a cleaning solution to the X1 to help with the hard scrubbing.\n",
            "The Roborock model also has the advantage that you don't have to remove the mop if you just want to vacuum, thanks to a feature that lifts it up when it goes over carpet.\n",
            "But the X1 Omni does a better job at cleaning its mop, filling a little sink in the dock with water and swirling them around every 15 minutes during a clean.\n",
            "(You can adjust this timing in the app.)\n",
            "Then, when it's finished, it will quietly blow hot air for two to four hours to get them properly dry.\n",
            "The Omni also has much larger tanks, but I still needed to refill them as often as the Roborock model (after every four or five cleans).\n",
            "I assume this is because its plush pads use more water.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is good at vacuuming, cleaning each room methodically while intelligently avoiding most obstacles.\n",
            "It heads back to empty its bin at the end of a run (a predictably loud process, although not too lengthy at around 12 seconds).\n",
            "I had no problems with clogging and it emptied the small bin effectively each time.\n",
            "But the X1 Omni is not the best sucker out there: the Roomba j7 and i3 and Roborock S7 and S7 MaxV are all more effective at getting up the dirt.\n",
            "One reason for this is that the Omni uses just one small bristle / rubber hybrid brush (the competition has larger rubber-only brushes).\n",
            "In my experience, these hybrid brushes get more easily tangled by hair and carpet fluff than rubber ones, making them less effective.\n",
            "I had to clean this one out every few days, which was another thing that took away from that promised hands-free experience.\n",
            "There are a lot of innovative and useful features on the X1 Omni, and I am very impressed by the design and functionality of the base station as well as Yiko.\n",
            "But the robot's cleaning prowess, while very good, isn't as good as the Roborock S7 Max V or Roomba j7, despite costing more.\n",
            "Ecovacs does have two cheaper models in its new flagship X1 series that dispense with a few features to cut costs (and size).\n",
            "Both offer Yiko voice control, AI obstacle avoidance, and 5,000 Pa suction power.\n",
            "(It doesn't auto-empty the bin, which is probably the best feature in recent robo vac innovation.)\n",
            "It also uses an upgraded version of Deebots' previous mopping technology, which is a flat cloth on a removable water tank.\n",
            "While I've not tested the X1 Plus, I have used Deebot's OZMO Pro mopping system before, and it's very effective, using vibration and downward pressure to remove dirt.\n",
            "And while the Roborock just edges the Deebot in overall cleaning ability, consider the X1 Omni if you want something that looks nicer in your home.\n",
            "Plus, the Yiko voice assistant is better at controlling the vacuum than Amazon's Alexa or Google's voice assistant (which it does work with), making it a good choice if don't have (or want to have) other voice assistants in your home.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is a very impressive device.\n",
            "But, even as a pioneer in this new category of home robot — where these bots can do so much more than just vacuum — it is very expensive and still has a few kinks to work out (specifically on the software side).\n",

            "Yiko voice recordings are stored locally on the device, but Ecovacs says these will move to servers later this year with user opt-in.\n",
            "The X1 hardware and apps have obtained the TÜV Rheinland privacy and security certification, whose requirements include passwords, secure storage, secure communication, and software updates.\n",
            "Map data is stored locally on the device and can be cleared with a factory reset.\n",
            "Photos and videos generated by the user while using the security camera feature (which is protected by a pin but not 2FA) are stored on Ecovacs' servers, where they are encrypted and not accessible to Ecovacs, third parties, or others.\n",
            "They can be viewed by the user and deleted directly in the app.\n",
            "There is also the option of saving photos and videos onto your mobile device.\n",
            "The device announces when it's recording or flashes a light (controlled in Settings in the app).\n",
            "In terms of a robot vacuum, the X1 Omni has all the high-end specs you'd expect: AI obstacle avoidance so it doesn't get tripped up by stray cables and socks; lidar navigation and mapping; 5,000 Pa of suction power; and a 5,200mAh battery that promises over four hours of cleaning on quiet mode.\n",
            "In testing, it never ran out of juice on standard mode when cleaning my 400-square-foot main floor, but when I pumped up the power to max suction and high water flow with two passes, it had to go back to charge after 70 minutes.\n",
            "You control the robot with the Ecovacs Home app, which has digital keep-out zones to keep the bot away from tricky or sensitive areas, room-specific and customized cleaning (so you can have the kitchen double mopped and the hallway vacuumed on max power but just lightly clean the dining room), four vacuuming modes, and three mopping modes.\n",
            "All this is in addition to the built-in voice assistant and security camera feature.\n",
            "It's a lot.\n",
            "And I'm not convinced that we need to throw the kitchen sink at the challenge of cleaning our floors (this model literally has a sink inside it for washing the mops).\n",
            "The phrase “too many cooks” is apt here, primarily because the X1 Omni software is not always up to all the tasks the hardware demands.\n",
            "It has AI-powered obstacle avoidance but was tripped up once by my fake dog turds (made from putty).\n",
            "While it ably avoided cables and shoes and other large objects, it also decided a smattering of Cocoa Krispies cereal and a gum wrapper should be avoided.\n",
            "The X1 navigated expertly around furniture, getting in between my kitchen stools and dining table chair legs without knocking anything over, but its 3-D mapping technology that should identify all my furniture automatically (so I can ask it to go clean around the couch) only found one piece of furniture in my house.\n",
            "You can add furniture manually in the Ecovacs app, but the X1 went through a phase of refusing to use the carefully crafted map on which I'd added keep-out zones and furniture, and instead created a new one on each run.\n",
            "I eventually fixed this by deleting all the maps and sending it out on another quick mapping run (which it did in under two minutes, faster than most lidar mapping robots that take five or six minutes to get my floorplan down).\n",
            "This time the map stuck, but it hasn't identified any more furniture and I'm reticent to put all that work in, in case it deletes it again.\n",
            "Software niggles aside, the X1's hardware is impressive, and this is a good-looking robot vacuum, a rarity in this space.\n",
            "Ecovacs tasked Danish firm Jacob Jensen Design (of Bang & Olufsen fame) to dream up this sleek, modern-looking robot and base.\n",
            "While the whole package is enormous (the base is two feet high and over a foot deep), it looks much better than Roborock's utilitarian auto empty, wash, and fill dock, and it does far more than iRobot's elegant auto-empty base for its j7 robot vacuum.\n",
            "Ecovacs' automatic Omni Station hides all the utilitarian features of this home cleaning robot inside a polished silver and matte black case.\n",
            "It packs in two removable, four-liter water tanks (one for dirty water, one for clean), a pop-out drawer for the dust bag, and a nice little cubby for the robot to hide in, tucking it away more discreetly than most charging docks.\n",
            "It looks good enough that you won't feel the need to hide this away, although you may struggle to find a home for it since it is so big.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is an excellent robot mop.\n",
            "Instead of the thin scrap of cloth you find on most mopping vacuums, it has two thick mopping pads that spin at 180 RPM.\n",
            "However, they have to be removed if you want to vacuum rugs or carpet, as the robot has rug-avoidance tech that stops it from dragging wet cloths over your carpet.\n",
            "You need to flip the entire robot over to install or uninstall them, and there's no storage spot for them in the giant Omni base.\n",
            "But the two pads look impressive as they do their spinning thing.\n",
            "While it mops much better than most hybrid mop/vacs, it wasn't any more effective at mopping than the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra.\n",
            "Both do excellent jobs of tackling light spills and cleaning up fine debris the vacuum missed, but neither can handle tougher jobs like ketchup or dried-up milk.\n",
            "You also can't add a cleaning solution to the X1 to help with the hard scrubbing.\n",
            "The Roborock model also has the advantage that you don't have to remove the mop if you just want to vacuum, thanks to a feature that lifts it up when it goes over carpet.\n",
            "But the X1 Omni does a better job at cleaning its mop, filling a little sink in the dock with water and swirling them around every 15 minutes during a clean.\n",
            "(You can adjust this timing in the app.)\n",
            "Then, when it's finished, it will quietly blow hot air for two to four hours to get them properly dry.\n",
            "The Omni also has much larger tanks, but I still needed to refill them as often as the Roborock model (after every four or five cleans).\n",
            "I assume this is because its plush pads use more water.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is good at vacuuming, cleaning each room methodically while intelligently avoiding most obstacles.\n",
            "It heads back to empty its bin at the end of a run (a predictably loud process, although not too lengthy at around 12 seconds).\n",
            "I had no problems with clogging and it emptied the small bin effectively each time.\n",
            "But the X1 Omni is not the best sucker out there: the Roomba j7 and i3 and Roborock S7 and S7 MaxV are all more effective at getting up the dirt.\n",
            "One reason for this is that the Omni uses just one small bristle / rubber hybrid brush (the competition has larger rubber-only brushes).\n",
            "In my experience, these hybrid brushes get more easily tangled by hair and carpet fluff than rubber ones, making them less effective.\n",
            "I had to clean this one out every few days, which was another thing that took away from that promised hands-free experience.\n",
            "There are a lot of innovative and useful features on the X1 Omni, and I am very impressed by the design and functionality of the base station as well as Yiko.\n",
            "But the robot's cleaning prowess, while very good, isn't as good as the Roborock S7 Max V or Roomba j7, despite costing more.\n",
            "Ecovacs does have two cheaper models in its new flagship X1 series that dispense with a few features to cut costs (and size).\n",
            "Both offer Yiko voice control, AI obstacle avoidance, and 5,000 Pa suction power.\n",
            "(It doesn't auto-empty the bin, which is probably the best feature in recent robo vac innovation.)\n",
            "It also uses an upgraded version of Deebots' previous mopping technology, which is a flat cloth on a removable water tank.\n",
            "While I've not tested the X1 Plus, I have used Deebot's OZMO Pro mopping system before, and it's very effective, using vibration and downward pressure to remove dirt.\n",
            "And while the Roborock just edges the Deebot in overall cleaning ability, consider the X1 Omni if you want something that looks nicer in your home.\n",
            "Plus, the Yiko voice assistant is better at controlling the vacuum than Amazon's Alexa or Google's voice assistant (which it does work with), making it a good choice if don't have (or want to have) other voice assistants in your home.\n",
            "The X1 Omni is a very impressive device.\n",
            "But, even as a pioneer in this new category of home robot — where these bots can do so much more than just vacuum — it is very expensive and still has a few kinks to work out (specifically on the software side).\n",
            "However, the future of hands-free home cleaning is looking good — very good.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "You need to register for an Ecovacs account using an email address to use the Ecovacs Home app (Android or iOS) and agree to Ecovacs' User Agreement and Privacy Policy:\n",
            "You can also opt into Ecovacs User Experience Improvement Plan, allowing the app to collect and analyze data from the robot, which the company says is to improve the user experience.\n",
            "In total, you get two mandatory and one optional agreement.\n",

            "But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy's price point.\n",
            "Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine.\n",
            "The HP Envy x360 13 is a beautiful convertible laptop with stellar processor options.\n",
            "The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover.\n",
            "It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC.\n",
            "But you're not compromising too much on performance for this device's tiny size; as long as you're not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine.\n",
            "And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we've seen in the past year.\n",
            "The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches.\n",
            "That's a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult's secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it's not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you're fine with quite a bit of squinting.\n",
            "The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is the best affordable Chromebook of 2022.\n",
            "The portable 2-in-1 device offers a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover as well as long battery life.\n",
            "It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space.\n",
            "The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot.\n",
            "The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is still one of our top choices for the best clamshell Chromebook to buy in 2022.\n",
            "If you like the Duet's size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice.\n",
            "Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen.\n",
            "But the CM3's kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally.\n",
            "Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel.\n",
            "Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work.\n",
            "Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power.\n",
            "Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings.\n",
            "The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best detachable laptop with a built-in pen and detachable screen.\n",
            "It offers a unique dual-folding kickstand, making it possible to fold the tablet so it stands up like a laptop or stands up horizontally.\n",
            "It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get.\n",
            "Not only does it perform well, but it's also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen.\n",
            "It's a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work.\n",
            "HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point.\n",
            "The audio on our model wasn't great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed.\n",
            "But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won't disappoint if you're looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.\n",
            "Similar in many ways to the more expensive Envy x360 13, the HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a high-quality budget laptop that's both incredibly light and powerful.\n",
            "It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in).\n",
            "It's a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn't included).\n",
            "On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we've ever seen on a Chromebook.\n",
            "You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack.\n",
            "It's easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well.\n",
            "The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 nails the basics.\n",
            "You'll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you're buying a lower-priced model.\n",
            "You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor.\n",
            "Those aren't the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time.\n",
            "It can run any Windows app, it's easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer.\n",
            "Microsoft's Surface Go 2 is a full-featured Windows tablet with a detachable keyboard and compatible stylus.\n",
            "It's light and compact, with a solid webcam and sturdy kickstand.\n",
            "Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3's exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills.\n",
            "Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here.\n",
            "But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors.\n",
            "We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well.\n",
            "On the outside, the Swift 3 isn't the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it's a solid performer in most areas.\n",
            "It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI.\n",
            "The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.\n",
            "Acer's Swift 3 laptop features a 14-inch 1080p IPS display, an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.\n",
            "It also sports a fingerprint reader for easy sign-in and a backlit keyboard, making typing in low-light situations a breeze.\n",
            "The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get.\n",
            "It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors.\n",
            "We were pleasantly surprised by the device's audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience.\n",
            "The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use.\n",
            "The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices.\n",
            "We're looking forward to reviewing its successor, the Yoga 7i, shortly in the future.\n",
            "The Lenovo Yoga C740 is great for any user who wants a no-nonsense, dependable laptop.\n",
            "No battery, no screen, no GPS, no fan, and no metal housing?\n",
            "There's a lot of stuff missing from the new GoPro Hero10 Black Bones.\n",
            "But then again, a normal GoPro isn't well-suited for the acrobatics of an FPV drone.\n",
            "So when GoPro sent us a review unit of its new stripped-down Hero10 Black designed for drone pilots, we recruited FPV drone pilot Reza Kurniawan to see if it's up to snuff — and you can see his flying skills on full display in our video review above.\n",
            "Kurniawan is the kind of drone enthusiast who inspired the Bones to begin with.\n",
            "He's been de-casing Hero10 GoPros to decrease their weight from 154 grams all the way down to about 33 grams.\n",
            "The demand for so-called “naked GoPros” has been high enough that it has become a service he provides to his customers, and the new Bones is a 54-gram version that GoPro sells itself.\n",
            "The internals of this camera are the same you'd find on the Hero10 Black.\n",
            "It has the same GP2 processor, HyperSmooth 4.0 in-body stabilization, and image sensor capable of filming 5.3K footage up to 60fps and 4K footage up to 120fps.\n",
            "But for now, Kurniawan and the rest of the community can put their soldering gear down.\n",
            "Or can they?\n",
            "Go watch our review of the Bones to find out.\n",
            "It's hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days.\n",
            "The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching wires.\n",
            "Things are much different now.\n",
            "After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds yet.\n",
            "You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you're willing to spend big.\n",
            "But those aren't always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you're looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\n",
            "Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that's another thing to consider as you shop around.\n",
            "Sony's WF-1000XM4 have the best noise cancellation of any true wireless earbuds, and the sound quality is second to none.\n",
            "With a new design that's smaller and rated IPX4, the earbuds also can now be charged wirelessly.\n",
            "In terms of overall excellence, the best wireless earbuds you can get are Sony's WF-1000XM4.\n",
            "They've got an unbeatable combo of top-notch active noise cancellation, wonderfully detailed audio, and long-lasting battery life.\n",
            "But we've also got a number of other picks based on other factors that you might rank higher.\n",
            "Though they come at a hefty price, the best overall wireless earbuds you can buy are Sony's WF-1000XM4.\n",
            "They offer superb, warm, detailed sound quality and top-tier active noise cancellation.\n",
            "And their impressive battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on, enough to outlast all of Sony's top competition.\n",
            "The WF-1000XM4s have a premium, matte black (or light gray) design with stylish rose gold accents.\n",
            "Most earbuds come with standard silicone ear tips, but Sony includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal that, together with the noise cancellation, do an impressive job at hushing the outside world.\n",
            "On Android phones, the 1000XM4s support Sony's LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback.\n",
            "But even when used on other platforms, they're up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 2 — with much better noise cancellation.\n",
            "The only thing preventing the 1000XM4 from being the perfect set of wireless earbuds is their lack of multipoint / two simultaneous Bluetooth connections.\n",
            "They're also on the larger side compared to some of the competition.\n",
            "But with their best-in-class mix of features (including bonuses like 360 Reality Audio support), improved voice call performance, and impressive battery endurance, you can't do much better.\n",
            "Their sound puts some emphasis on the bass but still manages to come through nicely balanced overall with very good clarity for this price range.\n",
            "Jabra's Elite 3 earbuds have a refreshed design that's more stylish than the company's past earbuds.\n",
            "While they don't have many frills or extra features, they fare well in the key areas of sound quality, comfort, and battery life.\n",
            "The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback, and the compact case holds three additional charges.\n",
            "Their large physical buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance.\n",
            "The Elite 3s lack the multipoint feature that Jabra has long been known for — that's the main sacrifice you make for the price — but in an improvement from past models, either earbud can be used standalone in mono mode.\n",
            "And they're extremely comfortable to wear for long stretches.\n",
            "You don't get features like active noise cancellation or wireless charging (though Jabra does include a so-so transparency mode), but the Elite 3s perform reliably with a strong Bluetooth signal.\n",
            "They're a terrific value for the money.\n",
            "Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds are neck and neck with Sony when it comes to the effectiveness of their active noise cancellation — and probably a hair better.\n",
            "Like their main rival, the QC Earbuds have a fit and finish that exudes quality.\n",
            "With dynamic, rich sound and the best noise cancellation available in true wireless earbuds, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a terrific pick if you want to listen to your music in peace.\n",
            "With Bose's mobile app, you can dial in the level of noise cancellation that's perfect for the environment you're in.\n",
            "Their charging case is a bit chunky, but it supports wireless charging.\n",
            "The QC Earbuds also handle voice calls better than most, so that's another plus in exchange for their pricey cost.\n",
            "The long-reigning champ of fitness earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro, have finally been defeated.\n",
            "And fittingly, they've been outdone by Beats' latest earbuds.\n",
            "The Beats Fit Pro trade the ear hooks of the Powerbeats for a new wing tip design that keeps them securely locked in your ears during even the most vigorous workouts.\n",
            "As a result, these earbuds have a much smaller form factor — and their carrying case is mercifully far more manageable.\n",
            "The way these earbuds magnetically latch into the case also means you don't have to worry about one or both buds failing to charge in the case, which was a common annoyance with the Powerbeats Pro.\n",
            "Unlike the Powerbeats Pro, the Fit Pros include active noise cancellation.\n",
            "And they're on par with the AirPods Pro in that department, so you'll be able to exercise without distraction.\n",
            "When you do want to stay alert to your surroundings, the transparency mode is also as natural-sounding and clear as on the AirPod Pros.\n",
            "The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have integrated wing tips that help keep them secure during runs and workouts.\n",
            "They also have excellent noise cancellation, and their sound has just the right amount of bass and kick to keep you motivated.\n",
            "The earbuds are rated IPX4 for water resistance.\n",
            "While that's not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions.\n",
            "The Fit Pros have easy-to-use physical button controls, and although they lack the dedicated volume rocker of the Powerbeats Pro, you've got the option to remap a long-press of each earbud to adjust volume instead of toggling noise cancellation.\n",
            "If you're an iPhone owner, the Fit Pros offer Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more.\n",
            "For Android users, Beats has an app that will let you adjust settings and see the battery status of the earbuds and case, among other functions.\n",
            "For those invested in Apple's ecosystem, the AirPods Pro offer an appealing mix of powerful noise cancellation, good-enough sound quality, and an array of features that make them the ideal companion to the company's other devices.\n",
            "They're also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit.\n",
            "The AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging.\n",
            "Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone.\n",
            "The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears.\n",
            "Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and they rank among the very best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality.\n",
            "Their ANC can't match Bose or Sony but is enough to quiet your surroundings a fair amount, and the transparency mode almost makes it feel like you're not wearing earbuds at all.\n",
            "Apple's flagship earbuds improve on the regular AirPods with better sound quality, excellent active noise cancellation, and immersive spatial audio.\n",
            "Where the AirPods stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic pairing with all of your Apple iCloud devices, auto device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on.\n",
            "They also support audio sharing, and if you've got an Apple TV and need to keep things quiet in the living room or bedroom, you can use the AirPods for private listening.\n",
            "The AirPods Pro are pretty standard in other areas like sound quality and battery life, but their deep intertwining with Apple's world is reason enough to give them serious consideration.\n",
            "Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 are so good that there's little reason to shell out more money for the Galaxy Buds Pro.\n",
            "They've got a small, discreet design that won't stick out of your ears like other buds.\n",
            "They sit more comfortably over long stretches of time than the company's Pro buds.\n",
            "And the Buds 2 produce balanced, vibrant sound that's quite close to the sound signature of the Pros.\n",
            "Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 have a stylish, low-profile design, and the earbuds are incredibly comfortable to wear even for long amounts of time.\n",
            "The earbuds feature active noise cancellation, pleasing sound quality, and wireless charging.\n",
            "If there's one downside, it's the below-average IPX2 water resistance, which makes them less than ideal for workouts or getting caught in the rain.\n",
            "The Buds Pro have a more worry-free IPX7 rating.\n",
            "OnePlus has come a long way since its original OnePlus Buds.\n",
            "The OnePlus Buds Pro are the company's most refined earbuds yet, with a sleek stemmed design that's right on par in comfort with Apple's AirPods Pro.\n",
            "There's no denying that these are AirPod clones, but their noise cancellation is slightly even better than Apple's, and there's a satisfactory transparency mode to go along with it.\n",
            "Though there's no denying their AirPods resemblance, the OnePlus Buds Pro manage to equal Apple's top-tier earbuds in comfort and best them in sound quality.\n",
            "The controls are pretty much an exact copy of the AirPods Pro squeeze gestures, but OnePlus manages to best Apple at durability: these are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance.\n",
            "For that price, you also get wireless charging in the case.\n",
            "And when it comes to calls, the OnePlus Buds Pro are among the very best performers out there with clear voice reproduction and excellent background noise cancellation so others can hear you perfectly.\n",
            "Apple's third-generation AirPods have a new design with shorter stems than the original model.\n",
            "But even with their mics now being farther from your mouth, they still perform very well on calls — and there are bigger improvements to sound quality and fit / comfort that make upgrading to the so-called AirPods 3 worthwhile.\n",
            "Apple's third-gen AirPods have a new design and sound significantly better than their predecessors.\n",
            "They also add new features like head tracking for spatial audio.\n",
            "Apple has also added new features that were previously exclusive to the AirPods Pro, like head tracking spatial audio and deeper Find My integration for hunting down your misplaced buds.\n",
            "And the case is now optimized to work with Apple's MagSafe wireless charging system.\n",
            "The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so you'll want to try them before buying to make sure they're the right match for your ears.\n",
            "But if they are, these are Apple's best regular AirPods yet by a wide margin.\n",
            "Sony's unconventional-looking LinkBuds have a donut hole right in the middle of each earbud.\n",
            "This surprisingly comfortable design is meant to allow in outside noise and keep you aware of your surroundings at all times.\n",
            "But it also means that the LinkBuds won't be for everyone — especially those people who prefer to drown out the world when listening to their music.\n",
            "But more than their quirky fit, the LinkBuds' greatest strength is stellar performance on voice calls.\n",
            "Sony reworked its voice isolation algorithms for these earbuds, and as a result, the LinkBuds are several rungs above the call quality of the flagship 1000XM4s and nearly all competitors minus AirPods.\n",
            "If you're looking for something you can pop into your ears throughout the workday, the LinkBuds don't disappoint.\n",
            "Sony's LinkBuds have a standout design that's rooted in comfort and an airy, open sound.\n",
            "They also excel when used for voice calls, outshining pretty much all competitors.\n",
            "The Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds have decent sound quality and active noise cancellation for their price.\n",
            "But likely, what's equally as important to avid mobile gamers is their low latency gaming mode that cuts response time down to 60ms.\n",
            "Razer's second-gen Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds feature the company's signature Chroma RGB lighting, good sound, and decent noise cancellation for the price.\n",
            "And then there's the Chroma.\n",
            "Unlike the first-gen Hammerhead True Wireless, these ones have fully customizable RGB lights on each earbud.\n",
            "It's an eye-catching effect, though it does eat into battery life a little.\n",
            "Razer's mobile app for the earbuds allows for control remapping and extensive EQ adjustment.\n",
            "The Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds are average in metrics like battery life, and their transparency mode is merely passable, but if you're big on Razer gear, now you can flash the brand while playing your favorite mobile games at the coffee shop.\n",
            "Though they can be buggier than we'd like, and their noise cancellation is run of the mill, there's no denying that the first earbuds from Nothing have a unique look.\n",
            "With their semi-translucent design and unique charging case, the Ear 1 earbuds will catch some attention when lined up with earbuds from more established brands.\n",
            "The first earbuds from Nothing have a partially translucent design and a unique carrying case.\n",
            "They mold to the shape of your ears in 60 seconds.\n",
            "That's really all that needs saying for you to know why the UE Fits surpass all other wireless earbuds at nailing the right fit.\n",
            "Short of visiting an audiologist and having custom IEMs made, you're not going to do much better.\n",
            "The UE Fits come with unique ear tips that permanently mold to the unique shape of your ears in just 60 seconds.\n",
            "This allows for a much better fit that you can comfortably wear for hours.\n",
            "But the Fits are really only worth it if you often struggle with keeping other earbuds in your ears.\n",
            "If you've exhausted all options (including trying memory foam tips), then definitely give these a try.\n",
            "The molding sensation — the tips warm up in your ears as they adapt their shape — is certainly unlike anything you'll get from other earbuds.\n",
            "The best Chromebooks aren't just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore.\n",
            "Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre Windows or MacOS laptop.\n",
            "That's why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2022 is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, which does just about everything right.\n",
            "The best Chromebooks from companies like Acer, Lenovo, and Asus are known to deliver good value.\n",
            "The message that many people actually want good Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers.\n",
            "The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you'll be happy with.\n",
            "For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent.\n",
            "There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they're all sourcing their components from the same factory.\n",
            "That's great news if you're comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount.\n",
            "They can even rival some of the best laptops, best budget laptops, and best student laptops on the market.\n",
            "Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we've selected the Lenovo Chromebook Duet for shoppers on a budget.\n",
            "Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the Google Pixelbook Go, the Asus Chromebook Flip CX5, and the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2.\n",
            "What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want.\n",
            "More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.\n",
            "Acer's Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy.\n",
            "With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you'll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking.\n",
            "The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting.\n",
            "There's even an HDMI port, which you don't see on a thin Chromebook every day.\n",
            "And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem.\n",
            "The Spin's speakers aren't great, and there's no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price.\n",
            "In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that's excellent in almost every way.\n",
            "The Chromebook Spin 713 is our choice for the best Chromebook to buy in 2022.\n",
            "If you're looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price.\n",
            "It's an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover.\n",
            "The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you're just browsing and don't plan on using a super heavy load.\n",
            "It also uses a version of Chrome OS that's made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that's optimized for tablet use.\n",
            "When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze.\n",
            "But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.\n",
            "Of course, there are drawbacks.\n",
            "The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there's no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim.\n",
            "But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price.\n",
            "It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.\n",
            "The Chromebook Duet boasts long battery life and has a 16:10 aspect ratio display to fit more content on the screen at once.\n",
            "The Duet can be used as a tablet or a laptop.\n",
            "On the downside, it has just one USB-C port and no 3.5mm headphone jack.\n",
            "The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus's attempt to compete with Lenovo's highly praised Chromebook Duet.\n",
            "Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off.\n",
            "It's a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features.\n",
            "One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally.\n",
            "We're not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it's there if you have a use case in mind.\n",
            "The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel.\n",
            "But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device.\n",
            "The CM3 won't be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings.\n",
            "But if you're looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn't quite suit your needs, you're likely the CM3's target audience.\n",
            "The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best detachable laptop with a built-in pen and detachable screen.\n",
            "It offers a unique dual-folding kickstand, making it possible to fold the tablet so it stands up like a laptop or stands up horizontally.\n",
            "Folks may understandably balk at the Chromebook Flip CX5's price, but it really is that good.\n",
            "It's sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, and has a unique velvety texture that's very pleasant to hold.\n",
            "Add a wide port selection, a smooth and comfortable keyboard, and a vivid display, and you've got a chassis that can hold its own against plenty of midrange Windows laptops.\n",
            "The CX5's performance is equally impressive.\n",
            "We never once heard its fan in our testing, even when pushing a workload that slows most devices down.\n",
            "Battery life is quite satisfactory and easily lasted us all day.\n",
            "And the CX5 delivered some of the loudest audio we've ever heard from a Chromebook.\n",
            "While the CX5 isn't a perfect device, it's a solid performer all around.\n",
            "The Asus Chromebook CX5 offers a great package for a bit of a steep price.\n",
            "The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn't so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative.\n",
            "The Chromebook 2's highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you're using it.\n",
            "(There's a gray option as well, if you'd prefer something subtle.)\n",
            "It's also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung's QLED panels.\n",
            "QLED isn't OLED — it's just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I've ever seen on a Chromebook.\n",
            "Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that's not the case here.\n",
            "I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn't need to plug it in too too often.\n",
            "And while the Core i3 processor isn't the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it's just fine for everyday work use.\n",
            "The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 nails the basics.\n",
            "The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds.\n",
            "It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.\n",
            "Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports.\n",
            "Battery life is also impressive.\n",
            "The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem.\n",
            "But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel.\n",
            "Verge editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.”\n",
            "The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn't top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price.\n",
            "But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.\n",
            "Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop with multiple USB-C ports, great travel, and enough battery life to get you through the workday.\n",
            "Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one.\n",
            "The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups.\n",
            "It's part of Lenovo's renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design.\n",
            "Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out.\n",
            "The C13 is also unique in that it's the first Chromebook to include AMD's Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks.\n",
            "The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly.\n",
            "We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge.\n",
            "We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem\n",
            "The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook is a convertible, premium Chromebook that targets adults and professionals, and boasts a strong processor and solid, sturdy build.\n",
            "It's built to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, but also has a smooth soft-touch texture that's pleasant to hold.\n",
            "Add a sleek backlit keyboard, a physical webcam shutter, and front-facing speakers, and you've got a chassis with hallmarks of a much more expensive device.\n",
            "You get some other perks as well.\n",
            "The Flex 5 has one of the better keyboards I've ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook at a midrange price point.\n",
            "It also has a useful port selection including a microSD reader and a USB-C port on each side, as well as a crisp 1920 x 1080 touch display.\n",
            "The one caveat is that the Flex 5 has somewhat disappointing battery life, averaging just over five and a half hours in our testing.\n",
            "If you'll be using the device while you're out and about, you'll want to make sure you bring the 45W charger with you.\n",

            "Portable gaming has always been a little, let's say, different.\n",
            "While there have been some attempts at shrinking console gaming down into something that will fit in your hands, many of the best handheld experiences have been downright weird.\n",
            "Think of the Nintendo DS with its dual screens that helped inspire memorable games about walking dogs, doing surgery, and, well, whatever is going on in Electroplankton.\n",
            "There's something about the smaller scale of these games that often invites creativity from developers.\n",
            "The Playdate, from first-time hardware maker Panic — best known for its Mac software and publishing games like Firewatch and Untitled Goose Game — takes this idea to the extreme.\n",
            "It's a tiny yellow square, not much bigger than a credit card, with a black-and-white screen and a crank that juts out of its side.\n",
            "It looks like a Game Boy from a parallel world.\n",
            "And, much like with the DS and its contemporaries, those limitations and distinct features have inspired a library of games unlike anything I've ever played: everything from a strategy game about cryptid photography and a turn-based samurai adventure to a role-playing game where all you do is manage inventory.\n",
            "And, just like with the DS, the best games are ones I couldn't imagine existing anywhere else.\n",
            "First, the basics.\n",
            "The Playdate measures in at a scant 76 × 74 × 9mm, a square about the size of a modern smartphone cut in half.\n",
            "It's probably the cutest dedicated handheld since the Game Boy Micro.\n",
            "About half of that space is taken up by a 400 x 240, 1-bit display capable of outputting visuals in glorious black and white.\n",
            "There is no backlight.\n",
            "Below the screen are a nice, clicky D-pad and two face buttons; a home button rests beside the display.\n",
            "Along the top edge is a sleep button, and the bottom has a USB-C port and headphone jack.\n",
            "The body is a bright yellow plastic with a nice matte texture.\n",
            "Inside, there's a battery that, in my experience, gets about eight hours of playtime on a single charge.\n",
            "(The Playdate comes with a USB-C cable, but you have to provide your own wall charger.)\n",
            "Oh yeah, and then there's a crank on the side of it.\n",
            "It's a little silver protrusion, about an inch long, that folds into the device when not in use.\n",
            "Basically, it's another control option that can be used for, well, a variety of things depending on the game.\n",
            "Some use it to scroll through text; others make it a way to control things like spaceships or surfboards.\n",
            "One game utilizes the crank so you can stir up magical potions.\n",
            "It's not a requirement for Playdate games, which is nice, but it does add something distinct to those that use it.\n",
            "Overall, aside from the slightly flimsy handle on the crank, it's a solid, well-made device.\n",
            "(For those curious, the hardware remains the same as it was when I previewed the Playdate last year.)\n",
            "My only real complaint is the lack of a backlight.\n",
            "While it's nowhere near as bad as, say, the original Game Boy Advance, the Playdate does require decent lighting to play games comfortably.\n",
            "There are a handful of titles that I would've loved to play before bed, but it just doesn't work with the dim display.\n",
            "The flip side is that, unlike many modern devices, the Playdate works extremely well in bright sunlight.\n",
            "Despite the seemingly low-fi nature of the device, games look crisp and clean, and developers have managed to cram some beautiful visuals onto it — from big, detailed character portraits to dense-but-readable interfaces.\n",
            "Panic says that, for those who pre-ordered and are in “group one,” units will start shipping on April 18th.\n",
            "Units for those customers will begin shipping “gradually today and in the coming weeks,” the company says.\n",
            "If you didn't pre-oder early, the company says that “we've already filled our production capacity for 2022, but we're ramping up to make even more Playdate systems for 2023.” Currently, Panic only has plans to ship units to the US, Canada, Japan, and a number of countries in Europe.\n",
            "Malaysia, where the handheld is manufactured, is not currently on the list of launch countries.\n",
            "You can check out the complete list here.\n",
            "When it's asleep, the Playdate displays a simple clock, and you wake it up by pressing the top button twice.\n",
            "The handheld's interface is simple — it's mostly just a list of your games along with a settings option — but there's a certain playfulness to it.\n",
            "You can scroll through a list of big, animated icons using the crank or D-pad, and adjusting the volume sounds like playing a xylophone.\n",
            "The wake-up animation looks like two eyes opening as you press the unlock button.\n",
            "It's straightforward, which makes sense because this thing is designed to do one thing: play games.\n",
            "And finding what you want to play is incredibly fast and simple.\n",
            "Outside of its unique look and crank, the Playdate is also notable for how you get access to games.\n",
            "Everyone who buys the handheld will automatically get a season of games, which release over time.\n",
            "(Right now it's not clear if subsequent seasons will happen.)\n",
            "As soon as you boot up your device and connect it to Wi-Fi, season 1 will begin, and you'll have two games automatically downloaded to the device every week for 12 weeks.\n",
            "That's a total of 24 games, and Panic has pulled in some notable developers to craft the initial batch, including Katamari creator Keita Takahashi and Bennett Foddy, the mind behind the infamous QWOP.\n",
            "When new games are delivered, a white light flashes on the top of the Playdate, and you have to virtually unwrap the icon before you play it.\n",
            "(It's a bit like digital games on the 3DS but more extravagant).\n",
            "It should also be noted that the games are tiny.\n",
            "The biggest one I have installed right now is just under 160MB, so it'll likely be a long time before the handheld's 4GB of storage is anywhere near full.\n",
            "For the purposes of this review, I wasn't able to experience the prolonged 12-week rollout.\n",
            "Instead, I had two games delivered every day.\n",
            "This meant that I haven't been able to spend as much time with these games as I would've liked.\n",
            "But even still, I've been impressed by the breadth of experiences available.\n",
            "Here, in no particular order, are the 10 games that have stuck with me the most so far.\n",
            "Inventory Hero is a bit like an idle RPG, the kind where your character acts on their own.\n",
            "But it's a lot more frantic.\n",
            "Your hero character runs through the fantasy world of their own accord, slicing up foes, and your only job is managing their inventory as loot comes flying out of bad guys.\n",
            "It sounds simple but there are limited slots and items are tossed at you constantly.\n",
            "You'll need to keep the hero's health topped up with potions, constantly replace their damaged armor and weapons, and toss out junk to keep slots open for good gear and items.\n",
            "(Sometimes a bunny will show up in your inventory and just keep breeding until all the slots are full.)\n",
            "It's a fun twist on a well-worn genre and an ideal portable game for when you only have a few minutes to play.\n",
            "Imagine Advance Wars, only instead of an army, you're controlling a squad of monster-hunting influencers.\n",
            "Sasquatchers is a turn-based game where the goal isn't to defeat the cryptids lurking around but instead take the perfect photo or video of them.\n",
            "There are units with different skills — the host who can take great selfies, the wrangler who can calm down Bigfoot, and more — and you have to manage your health and battery life while exploring dark, dangerous forests.\n",
            "The goal is to take photos that get lots of likes and views, which earn you money, opening up new units and maps.\n",
            "My favorite part is how Sasquatchers uses the crank: it serves as your camera, so you have to turn it around to nail the picture or video you're attempting.\n",
            "It's very satisfying.\n",
            "Zach Gage is best known for reinventing classic games ranging from chess to sudoku.\n",
            "On the Playdate, he does the same for Snake.\n",
            "It works a lot like it did on your old Nokia: you control a snake as it twists around a rectangular level, trying not to crash into a wall or your own overlong body.\n",
            "But there are a few twists.\n",
            "In Snak you can jump over your own body, and you earn points by eating apples that float into the level.\n",
            "It's familiar but just different enough to feel fresh, and there are multiple difficulty levels that increase the speed dramatically for an extra challenge.\n",
            "Snak doesn't use the crank at all, but it fits the Playdate's retro aesthetic very well.\n",
            "Saturday Edition is, essentially, a tiny LucasArts adventure game crammed onto the Playdate's miniature screen.\n",
            "You play as a man roped into a strange mystery involving dozens of missing people, and, just like in classic point-and-click adventure games, you do that by talking to lots of characters and collecting items to solve puzzles.\n",
            "It's all fairly straightforward here — don't expect any of the obscure, frustrating logic puzzles the genre is known for — but I've mostly been surprised by how comfortable it's been to sit back and enjoy a game that's almost entirely reading on such a small screen.\n",
            "This is a game about exploring strange places while (mostly) following the rules of chess.\n",
            "You start as a pawn, moving through a grid-based world that's like a chessboard that's been hacked.\n",
            "Initially, you can move one space forward at a time and only diagonally to knock enemies off the board, just like a pawn.\n",
            "From there, there are interesting twists, like treasure chests to refill your health or unlock new pieces (e.g., the knight) to play as for new movement options.\n",
            "On occasion, you'll need to use the crank to move tiles around in order to proceed.\n",
            "Each level is a short, self-contained puzzle, and the game is rendered with a cryptic tone that makes it feel like you're inside an old, broken computer.\n",
            "If you ever played the excellent and stylish Bit Generations line of games from Nintendo, Omaze will feel familiar.\n",
            "It's a seemingly basic puzzle game where you rotate a dot around the inside of a maze made up of connected spheres.\n",
            "It makes great use of the crank, which you use to control the dot, and it steadily throws in new concepts — like enemy dots and reversed movement — to keep things interesting.\n",
            "Like the best puzzle games, Omaze is a straightforward concept executed extremely well.\n",
            "And its minimalist visuals mean that it not only looks great but also is always clear about what you need to do.\n",
            "Zipper combines the challenge of a turn-based strategy game with the tone of a classic samurai film.\n",
            "You control a samurai fighting their way through a series of rooms and gardens filled with guards.\n",
            "The title comes from how you move; your little samurai can zip across a grid, slashing any enemies it passes along the way.\n",
            "After you move, the guards act, and the challenge lies in strategically planning your movements so that you can eliminate your enemies without giving them the opportunity to strike.\n",
            "It's also extremely hard thanks to its one-hit deaths: a single mistake and you have to restart the entire game.\n",
            "Crankin's Time Travel Adventure is probably the closest the Playdate has to a showcase game.\n",
            "It's created by a big name — Keita Takahashi is best known for the seminal Katamari Damacy — and it's a game built entirely around the crank.\n",
            "The premise is simple: Crankin is late for a date, and he keeps running into obstacles on his way there.\n",
            "These range from surprisingly strong butterflies to hordes of rushing pigs.\n",
            "In order to avoid these, you utilize the crank to control time, fast-forwarding or reversing to move Crankin away from danger.\n",
            "For instance, he always stops to smell flowers, so you can avoid flying enemies by moving him to a flower bed.\n",
            "It's quirky and fun, and a game that definitely wouldn't exist on any other platform.\n",
            "Casual Birder is kind of like Pokémon meets… Pokémon Snap.\n",
            "It looks like a 16-bit RPG, but there are no battles or epic quests.\n",

            "Correction April 18th, 3:30PM ET: An earlier version of this story listed the incorrect developers for Saturday Edition.\n",
            "Portable gaming has always been a little, let's say, different.\n",
            "While there have been some attempts at shrinking console gaming down into something that will fit in your hands, many of the best handheld experiences have been downright weird.\n",
            "Think of the Nintendo DS with its dual screens that helped inspire memorable games about walking dogs, doing surgery, and, well, whatever is going on in Electroplankton.\n",
            "There's something about the smaller scale of these games that often invites creativity from developers.\n",
            "The Playdate, from first-time hardware maker Panic — best known for its Mac software and publishing games like Firewatch and Untitled Goose Game — takes this idea to the extreme.\n",
            "It's a tiny yellow square, not much bigger than a credit card, with a black-and-white screen and a crank that juts out of its side.\n",
            "It looks like a Game Boy from a parallel world.\n",
            "And, much like with the DS and its contemporaries, those limitations and distinct features have inspired a library of games unlike anything I've ever played: everything from a strategy game about cryptid photography and a turn-based samurai adventure to a role-playing game where all you do is manage inventory.\n",
            "And, just like with the DS, the best games are ones I couldn't imagine existing anywhere else.\n",
            "First, the basics.\n",
            "The Playdate measures in at a scant 76 × 74 × 9mm, a square about the size of a modern smartphone cut in half.\n",
            "It's probably the cutest dedicated handheld since the Game Boy Micro.\n",
            "About half of that space is taken up by a 400 x 240, 1-bit display capable of outputting visuals in glorious black and white.\n",
            "There is no backlight.\n",
            "Below the screen are a nice, clicky D-pad and two face buttons; a home button rests beside the display.\n",
            "Along the top edge is a sleep button, and the bottom has a USB-C port and headphone jack.\n",
            "The body is a bright yellow plastic with a nice matte texture.\n",
            "Inside, there's a battery that, in my experience, gets about eight hours of playtime on a single charge.\n",
            "(The Playdate comes with a USB-C cable, but you have to provide your own wall charger.)\n",
            "Oh yeah, and then there's a crank on the side of it.\n",
            "It's a little silver protrusion, about an inch long, that folds into the device when not in use.\n",
            "Basically, it's another control option that can be used for, well, a variety of things depending on the game.\n",
            "Some use it to scroll through text; others make it a way to control things like spaceships or surfboards.\n",
            "One game utilizes the crank so you can stir up magical potions.\n",
            "It's not a requirement for Playdate games, which is nice, but it does add something distinct to those that use it.\n",
            "Overall, aside from the slightly flimsy handle on the crank, it's a solid, well-made device.\n",
            "(For those curious, the hardware remains the same as it was when I previewed the Playdate last year.)\n",
            "My only real complaint is the lack of a backlight.\n",
            "While it's nowhere near as bad as, say, the original Game Boy Advance, the Playdate does require decent lighting to play games comfortably.\n",
            "There are a handful of titles that I would've loved to play before bed, but it just doesn't work with the dim display.\n",
            "The flip side is that, unlike many modern devices, the Playdate works extremely well in bright sunlight.\n",
            "Despite the seemingly low-fi nature of the device, games look crisp and clean, and developers have managed to cram some beautiful visuals onto it — from big, detailed character portraits to dense-but-readable interfaces.\n",
            "Panic says that, for those who pre-ordered and are in “group one,” units will start shipping on April 18th.\n",
            "Units for those customers will begin shipping “gradually today and in the coming weeks,” the company says.\n",
            "If you didn't pre-oder early, the company says that “we've already filled our production capacity for 2022, but we're ramping up to make even more Playdate systems for 2023.” Currently, Panic only has plans to ship units to the US, Canada, Japan, and a number of countries in Europe.\n",
            "Malaysia, where the handheld is manufactured, is not currently on the list of launch countries.\n",
            "You can check out the complete list here.\n",
            "When it's asleep, the Playdate displays a simple clock, and you wake it up by pressing the top button twice.\n",
            "The handheld's interface is simple — it's mostly just a list of your games along with a settings option — but there's a certain playfulness to it.\n",
            "You can scroll through a list of big, animated icons using the crank or D-pad, and adjusting the volume sounds like playing a xylophone.\n",
            "The wake-up animation looks like two eyes opening as you press the unlock button.\n",
            "It's straightforward, which makes sense because this thing is designed to do one thing: play games.\n",
            "And finding what you want to play is incredibly fast and simple.\n",
            "Outside of its unique look and crank, the Playdate is also notable for how you get access to games.\n",
            "Everyone who buys the handheld will automatically get a season of games, which release over time.\n",
            "(Right now it's not clear if subsequent seasons will happen.)\n",
            "As soon as you boot up your device and connect it to Wi-Fi, season 1 will begin, and you'll have two games automatically downloaded to the device every week for 12 weeks.\n",
            "That's a total of 24 games, and Panic has pulled in some notable developers to craft the initial batch, including Katamari creator Keita Takahashi and Bennett Foddy, the mind behind the infamous QWOP.\n",
            "When new games are delivered, a white light flashes on the top of the Playdate, and you have to virtually unwrap the icon before you play it.\n",
            "(It's a bit like digital games on the 3DS but more extravagant).\n",
            "It should also be noted that the games are tiny.\n",
            "The biggest one I have installed right now is just under 160MB, so it'll likely be a long time before the handheld's 4GB of storage is anywhere near full.\n",
            "For the purposes of this review, I wasn't able to experience the prolonged 12-week rollout.\n",
            "Instead, I had two games delivered every day.\n",
            "This meant that I haven't been able to spend as much time with these games as I would've liked.\n",
            "But even still, I've been impressed by the breadth of experiences available.\n",
            "Here, in no particular order, are the 10 games that have stuck with me the most so far.\n",
            "Inventory Hero is a bit like an idle RPG, the kind where your character acts on their own.\n",
            "But it's a lot more frantic.\n",
            "Your hero character runs through the fantasy world of their own accord, slicing up foes, and your only job is managing their inventory as loot comes flying out of bad guys.\n",
            "It sounds simple but there are limited slots and items are tossed at you constantly.\n",
            "You'll need to keep the hero's health topped up with potions, constantly replace their damaged armor and weapons, and toss out junk to keep slots open for good gear and items.\n",
            "(Sometimes a bunny will show up in your inventory and just keep breeding until all the slots are full.)\n",
            "It's a fun twist on a well-worn genre and an ideal portable game for when you only have a few minutes to play.\n",
            "Imagine Advance Wars, only instead of an army, you're controlling a squad of monster-hunting influencers.\n",
            "Sasquatchers is a turn-based game where the goal isn't to defeat the cryptids lurking around but instead take the perfect photo or video of them.\n",
            "There are units with different skills — the host who can take great selfies, the wrangler who can calm down Bigfoot, and more — and you have to manage your health and battery life while exploring dark, dangerous forests.\n",
            "The goal is to take photos that get lots of likes and views, which earn you money, opening up new units and maps.\n",
            "My favorite part is how Sasquatchers uses the crank: it serves as your camera, so you have to turn it around to nail the picture or video you're attempting.\n",
            "It's very satisfying.\n",
            "Zach Gage is best known for reinventing classic games ranging from chess to sudoku.\n",
            "On the Playdate, he does the same for Snake.\n",
            "It works a lot like it did on your old Nokia: you control a snake as it twists around a rectangular level, trying not to crash into a wall or your own overlong body.\n",
            "But there are a few twists.\n",
            "In Snak you can jump over your own body, and you earn points by eating apples that float into the level.\n",
            "It's familiar but just different enough to feel fresh, and there are multiple difficulty levels that increase the speed dramatically for an extra challenge.\n",
            "Snak doesn't use the crank at all, but it fits the Playdate's retro aesthetic very well.\n",
            "Saturday Edition is, essentially, a tiny LucasArts adventure game crammed onto the Playdate's miniature screen.\n",
            "You play as a man roped into a strange mystery involving dozens of missing people, and, just like in classic point-and-click adventure games, you do that by talking to lots of characters and collecting items to solve puzzles.\n",
            "It's all fairly straightforward here — don't expect any of the obscure, frustrating logic puzzles the genre is known for — but I've mostly been surprised by how comfortable it's been to sit back and enjoy a game that's almost entirely reading on such a small screen.\n",
            "This is a game about exploring strange places while (mostly) following the rules of chess.\n",
            "You start as a pawn, moving through a grid-based world that's like a chessboard that's been hacked.\n",
            "Initially, you can move one space forward at a time and only diagonally to knock enemies off the board, just like a pawn.\n",
            "From there, there are interesting twists, like treasure chests to refill your health or unlock new pieces (e.g., the knight) to play as for new movement options.\n",
            "On occasion, you'll need to use the crank to move tiles around in order to proceed.\n",
            "Each level is a short, self-contained puzzle, and the game is rendered with a cryptic tone that makes it feel like you're inside an old, broken computer.\n",
            "If you ever played the excellent and stylish Bit Generations line of games from Nintendo, Omaze will feel familiar.\n",
            "It's a seemingly basic puzzle game where you rotate a dot around the inside of a maze made up of connected spheres.\n",
            "It makes great use of the crank, which you use to control the dot, and it steadily throws in new concepts — like enemy dots and reversed movement — to keep things interesting.\n",
            "Like the best puzzle games, Omaze is a straightforward concept executed extremely well.\n",
            "And its minimalist visuals mean that it not only looks great but also is always clear about what you need to do.\n",
            "Zipper combines the challenge of a turn-based strategy game with the tone of a classic samurai film.\n",
            "You control a samurai fighting their way through a series of rooms and gardens filled with guards.\n",
            "The title comes from how you move; your little samurai can zip across a grid, slashing any enemies it passes along the way.\n",
            "After you move, the guards act, and the challenge lies in strategically planning your movements so that you can eliminate your enemies without giving them the opportunity to strike.\n",
            "It's also extremely hard thanks to its one-hit deaths: a single mistake and you have to restart the entire game.\n",
            "Crankin's Time Travel Adventure is probably the closest the Playdate has to a showcase game.\n",
            "It's created by a big name — Keita Takahashi is best known for the seminal Katamari Damacy — and it's a game built entirely around the crank.\n",
            "The premise is simple: Crankin is late for a date, and he keeps running into obstacles on his way there.\n",
            "These range from surprisingly strong butterflies to hordes of rushing pigs.\n",
            "In order to avoid these, you utilize the crank to control time, fast-forwarding or reversing to move Crankin away from danger.\n",
            "For instance, he always stops to smell flowers, so you can avoid flying enemies by moving him to a flower bed.\n",
            "It's quirky and fun, and a game that definitely wouldn't exist on any other platform.\n",
            "Casual Birder is kind of like Pokémon meets… Pokémon Snap.\n",
            "It looks like a 16-bit RPG, but there are no battles or epic quests.\n",
            "Instead, you're the new resident in a small town obsessed with birding, and your goal is to snap a photo of every kind of bird around.\n",
            "You do this by collecting info from local haunts like the café and pool hall, gathering useful items like worms, and listening for the screech or song of nearby creatures.\n",
            "Once you find a bird, you pull out your camera and utilize the crank to focus the picture for the perfect shot.\n",

            "The Odin's fan is almost inaudible on its normal setting, very quiet in performance mode, and about on par with a Nintendo Switch at its loudest in high performance mode.\n",

            "The difference, though, is that the Odin has active cooling, so it's able to run the processor at its highest speed for longer periods of time, unlike thin smartphones, which don't have fans and need to throttle their performance to stay cool.\n",
            "The Odin's fan is almost inaudible on its normal setting, very quiet in performance mode, and about on par with a Nintendo Switch at its loudest in high performance mode.\n",

            "Emulation is inherently hit and miss, and your results will vary depending on how you tweak settings and which emulators you choose.\n",

            "It won't be the best choice for everyone, but it's a good reminder that many people don't need to pay thousands of dollars or sacrifice all-day battery life in order to get a large-screened laptop.\n",
            "Part of this is probably that Lenovo's name is on both of these devices, but using the IdeaPad feels similar to using a (much more expensive) ThinkPad in many ways.\n",
            "It's not as instantly recognizable as a ThinkPad (the two exciting color options are Cloud Gray and Storm Gray), but it is certainly built as well, with a sturdy aluminum chassis and a comfortable finish that didn't scratch easily in my testing period.\n",

            "The 120Hz refresh rate makes a noticeable difference when you're scrolling through long articles or documents (as I do every day) — after spending a bit of time at 120Hz, going back to 60Hz just feels wrong.\n",
            "Otherwise, the panel reached 364 nits of brightness in my testing and displayed bright and accurate colors.\n",
            "It was also glossy and kicked back noticeable glare indoors, but nothing that inhibited my work.\n",
            "The only real gap in connectivity is the lack of Thunderbolt since this is an AMD system.\n",
            "There are two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, one HDMI 1.4b, one card reader, and one combo audio jack.\n",
            "Besides Thunderbolt accessories, I was able to plug whatever I needed to in without any trouble.\n",
            "Being able to charge by USB-C, in addition to the dedicated power port, was also handy.\n",
            "Speaking of audio, the speakers are not the loudest around, but they deliver surprisingly clear sound with distinguishable levels.\n",
            "Lenovo enthusiasts should note that there is one way in which the IdeaPad differs significantly from its older ThinkPad cousins: the webcam.\n",
            "It supports both Windows Hello and presence detection, which are handy.\n",
            "But there's also not an easy way to turn it off.\n",
            "This won't be a problem for everyone, but I really like the shutter many physical ThinkPad models have — as someone who uses their webcam all day, it's nice to be able to double-confirm that it's turned off.\n",
            "The Slim 7 Pro doesn't have a physical shutter, nor is there a default kill switch on the keyboard; you have to dive into Lenovo's software to turn it off.\n",
            "On the inside, my test unit has AMD's Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 GPU.\n",
            "As far as I can see from Lenovo's website, this is the only configuration available.\n",
            "And it's fast.\n",
            "I ran Zoom calls over heaps of Chrome tabs with no slowdown, fan noise, or keyboard heat of any kind, even with Battery Saver on.\n",
            "The Ryzen 7 5800H is a good processor, and I wouldn't expect it to have trouble with the tasks most people are doing.\n",
            "The RTX 3050 wouldn't be the best choice for, say, full-resolution gaming, but it should be able to lend a hand in graphics-heavy workloads just fine.\n",
            "Battery life is an area where the Slim 7 Pro may fall short for some folks.\n",
            "I was getting around seven and a half hours of continuous use with the screen at medium brightness.\n",
            "That is impressive for a 16-incher with such a high-resolution panel, but you can certainly find laptops at this price point that will last longer.\n",
            "The one part of the Slim 7 experience where the cracks do start to show is bloatware.\n",

            "With a solid build and an unobtrusive look, a comprehensive port selection, and a high-resolution, high refresh rate, 16:10 display, the Slim 7 (if you can find one in stock) is a competitive machine all around.\n",
            "It won't be the best choice for everyone, but it's a good reminder that many people don't need to pay thousands of dollars or sacrifice all-day battery life in order to get a large-screened laptop.\n",
            "Part of this is probably that Lenovo's name is on both of these devices, but using the IdeaPad feels similar to using a (much more expensive) ThinkPad in many ways.\n",
            "It's not as instantly recognizable as a ThinkPad (the two exciting color options are Cloud Gray and Storm Gray), but it is certainly built as well, with a sturdy aluminum chassis and a comfortable finish that didn't scratch easily in my testing period.\n",
            "You may notice that there's a slight lip at the top of the display where the webcam lives.\n",
            "By slight, I do mean slight — it's a significantly less noticeable protrusion than you'll find on, say, the ThinkPad Z Series.\n",

            "That's portable for a 16-incher, but I want to make sure people don't see “Slim” and go in expecting an LG Gram.\n",

            "Otherwise, the panel reached 364 nits of brightness in my testing and displayed bright and accurate colors.\n",
            "It was also glossy and kicked back noticeable glare indoors, but nothing that inhibited my work.\n",
            "The only real gap in connectivity is the lack of Thunderbolt since this is an AMD system.\n",
            "There are two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, one HDMI 1.4b, one card reader, and one combo audio jack.\n",
            "Besides Thunderbolt accessories, I was able to plug whatever I needed to in without any trouble.\n",
            "Being able to charge by USB-C, in addition to the dedicated power port, was also handy.\n",
            "Speaking of audio, the speakers are not the loudest around, but they deliver surprisingly clear sound with distinguishable levels.\n",
            "Lenovo enthusiasts should note that there is one way in which the IdeaPad differs significantly from its older ThinkPad cousins: the webcam.\n",
            "It supports both Windows Hello and presence detection, which are handy.\n",
            "But there's also not an easy way to turn it off.\n",
            "This won't be a problem for everyone, but I really like the shutter many physical ThinkPad models have — as someone who uses their webcam all day, it's nice to be able to double-confirm that it's turned off.\n",
            "The Slim 7 Pro doesn't have a physical shutter, nor is there a default kill switch on the keyboard; you have to dive into Lenovo's software to turn it off.\n",
            "On the inside, my test unit has AMD's Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 GPU.\n",
            "As far as I can see from Lenovo's website, this is the only configuration available.\n",
            "And it's fast.\n",
            "I ran Zoom calls over heaps of Chrome tabs with no slowdown, fan noise, or keyboard heat of any kind, even with Battery Saver on.\n",
            "The Ryzen 7 5800H is a good processor, and I wouldn't expect it to have trouble with the tasks most people are doing.\n",

            "I was getting around seven and a half hours of continuous use with the screen at medium brightness.\n",
            "That is impressive for a 16-incher with such a high-resolution panel, but you can certainly find laptops at this price point that will last longer.\n",

            "I used the phone indoors more than out, but I still needed the brightness cranked up to 80 or 90 percent at all times.\n",
            "Visibility isn't great in direct sunlight, but it's just good enough to see what you're doing.\n",
            "The faster-than-standard refresh rate is nice, and you'll notice a little extra smoothness as you scroll.\n",
            "As you might have guessed, that huge screen makes the whole phone big.\n",
            "Really big.\n",
            "There's no chance of using this thing comfortably with one hand, and it looks ridiculous sticking out of the pocket of my joggers.\n",
            "I got used to it over a few days, and the big screen certainly fits a lot of content, but it's definitely a lot of phone.\n",
            "The stylus feature set covers all the basics.\n",

            "To each their own.\n",
            "Motorola claims that the G Stylus' 5,000mAh battery will last up to two days on a single charge, so I took that as a challenge.\n",
            "After the first day I spent testing the phone, the battery was down around 50 percent, but I didn't recharge overnight and trusted it to last through the next day.\n",
            "It did and, in total, I got about 6.5 hours of screen-on time and was down to 18 percent by the end of day two.\n",
            "I spent a lot of that time on Wi-Fi, which probably helped, but I did bump the screen refresh rate up to the highest setting to push it a little.\n",
            "Either way, that's impressive stamina, and even heavy users would likely get through a full day without needing to top off the battery.\n",
            "Overall performance is good, too.\n",
            "There are stutters and slight hesitations here and there as I open apps and scroll through video and image-heavy screens but nothing that impacts my daily use.\n",
            "The phone's 6GB of RAM keeps lots of apps running in the background, and I'm impressed by how easily I can switch back to an app I was using hours ago and pick up right where I left off.\n",
            "You can run a graphics-intensive game like Genshin Impact, just expect to see some noticeable stuttering and dropped frames.\n",
            "But that's not really what this phone is for anyway.\n",
            "Most new phones in 2022 are shipping with Android 12 at this point in the year, but the G Stylus is still pre-loaded with Android 11.\n",
            "Motorola says the phone will get upgraded to Android 12 — that will be its only OS version upgrade — but isn't offering any specifics on timing.\n",
            "The company also promises three years of security updates on an every-other-month schedule, which is one year longer than it promised with last year's model.\n",
            "That's an improvement but still falls short of Samsung's commitment of four years (and even five years for some of its A-series budget phones).\n",
            "This is normally when I'd cover which 5G bands this phone can use, but, in this case, it's an easy answer: none of them.\n",
            "Unlike a year or two ago, 5G connectivity is something you should consider when buying a new phone.\n",
            "T-Mobile's 5G network is already fairly strong; likewise, Verizon and AT&T's networks will improve over the next couple of years.\n",
            "For the most part, that will mean noticeably faster speeds compared to 4G, so that's something the Moto G Stylus won't be able to take advantage of.\n",
            "It's a strike against the Moto G Stylus but not a dealbreaker.\n",
            "The 5G expansion in the US will be focused on major cities at first, so if you live somewhere more rural, having a 5G device probably isn't a priority now or in the near future.\n",
            "And, if you're otherwise happy with 4G speeds or spend most of your time on Wi-Fi anyway, then you'll be just fine with a 4G device for the next few years.\n",
            "The Moto G Stylus isn't really designed to last much longer than that anyway.\n",
            "There appear to be three cameras on the G Stylus' rear panel, but one of them is a 2-megapixel depth sensor that you can ignore.\n",
            "There's a 50-megapixel f/1.9 standard wide camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 16-megapixel selfie camera.\n",
            "Last year's model had a dedicated macro camera; this time, the ultrawide does double duty as the macro sensor.\n",
            "Overall, the G Stylus' cameras produce well-balanced images without going overboard on color saturation or HDR effects in high-contrast scenes.\n",
            "Both rear cameras do a good job in good lighting, but there's some noticeable noise in images from the 8-megapixel ultrawide taken in moderately low light.\n",
            "There's also some noticeable lag between when you tap the shutter and when it actually takes a photo, which is fairly common for a budget phone.\n",
            "Night vision is helpful in very low light if your subject isn't moving.\n",
            "It doesn't work miracles, but at least this budget phone has a night mode — unlike another I recently reviewed.\n",
            "Video recording is only available at 1080p, which is unusual.\n",
            "(Most phones these days can shoot 4K video.)\n",
            "There's a fairly aggressive crop, too, even if you turn electronic stabilization off.\n",
            "I don't imagine the lack of 4K resolution video will bother a lot of people buying this phone, but 4K is more or less the new standard for high-resolution video, so that's something to note if video is important to you.\n",
            "Otherwise, 1080p clips are just fine, and the smaller file sizes are easier to share anyway.\n",
            "You're not going to find the Moto G Stylus on the shelves at a Verizon or T-Mobile store.\n",
            "The major carriers are far too interested in getting 5G phones into their customers' hands to waste any of that valuable retail space on a 4G device.\n",
            "And it's not all marketing bluster anymore; true 5G really is arriving, and it really will be faster than 4G.\n",
            "But just because the carriers think it's the right time to put a 5G device in your hand doesn't mean you absolutely have to buy one.\n",
            "If you're fine with 4G and will be over the next few years, then the Moto G Stylus is a great deal.\n",
            "That's not even considering its headline feature: the stylus.\n",
            "It's handy, and even if it doesn't get much use, the phone is still well-priced even without it.\n",
            "If you do want something a little more future-proofed, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is a good option while it's still in stock.\n",
            "For the same price as the Moto G Stylus, it offers similar performance and equally good battery stamina.\n",
            "On the downside, its screen is smaller and lower res, it only comes with 64GB of storage, and, of course, there's no stylus.\n",
            "If you're not concerned about future-proofing for the next generation of wireless technology and a big phone with a big screen is just your size, then the Moto G Stylus is the bargain rack deal for you.\n",

            "Visibility isn't great in direct sunlight, but it's just good enough to see what you're doing.\n",
            "The faster-than-standard refresh rate is nice, and you'll notice a little extra smoothness as you scroll.\n",
            "As you might have guessed, that huge screen makes the whole phone big.\n",
            "Really big.\n",
            "There's no chance of using this thing comfortably with one hand, and it looks ridiculous sticking out of the pocket of my joggers.\n",
            "I got used to it over a few days, and the big screen certainly fits a lot of content, but it's definitely a lot of phone.\n",
            "The stylus feature set covers all the basics.\n",
            "There's a straightforward note-taking app that's the first thing you'll see when you pop the stylus out of its silo on the bottom of the phone.\n",
            "There's also a coloring book and a shortcut to capture a screenshot so you can notate or doodle on the image.\n",
            "Nothing as fancy or as advanced as the much, much more expensive Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can do but a nice tool to have when you want to jot something down without unlocking your phone, even if you don't end up using it often.\n",
            "In fact, my own mother, a Motorola devotee and G Stylus 2021 owner, sealed hers up with a case that covers the stylus silo entirely.\n",
            "She's perfectly happy with her phone sans stylus.\n",
            "To each their own.\n",
            "Motorola claims that the G Stylus' 5,000mAh battery will last up to two days on a single charge, so I took that as a challenge.\n",
            "After the first day I spent testing the phone, the battery was down around 50 percent, but I didn't recharge overnight and trusted it to last through the next day.\n",
            "It did and, in total, I got about 6.5 hours of screen-on time and was down to 18 percent by the end of day two.\n",
            "I spent a lot of that time on Wi-Fi, which probably helped, but I did bump the screen refresh rate up to the highest setting to push it a little.\n",
            "Either way, that's impressive stamina, and even heavy users would likely get through a full day without needing to top off the battery.\n",
            "Overall performance is good, too.\n",
            "There are stutters and slight hesitations here and there as I open apps and scroll through video and image-heavy screens but nothing that impacts my daily use.\n",
            "The phone's 6GB of RAM keeps lots of apps running in the background, and I'm impressed by how easily I can switch back to an app I was using hours ago and pick up right where I left off.\n",
            "You can run a graphics-intensive game like Genshin Impact, just expect to see some noticeable stuttering and dropped frames.\n",
            "But that's not really what this phone is for anyway.\n",
            "Most new phones in 2022 are shipping with Android 12 at this point in the year, but the G Stylus is still pre-loaded with Android 11.\n",
            "Motorola says the phone will get upgraded to Android 12 — that will be its only OS version upgrade — but isn't offering any specifics on timing.\n",
            "The company also promises three years of security updates on an every-other-month schedule, which is one year longer than it promised with last year's model.\n",
            "That's an improvement but still falls short of Samsung's commitment of four years (and even five years for some of its A-series budget phones).\n",
            "This is normally when I'd cover which 5G bands this phone can use, but, in this case, it's an easy answer: none of them.\n",
            "Unlike a year or two ago, 5G connectivity is something you should consider when buying a new phone.\n",
            "T-Mobile's 5G network is already fairly strong; likewise, Verizon and AT&T's networks will improve over the next couple of years.\n",
            "For the most part, that will mean noticeably faster speeds compared to 4G, so that's something the Moto G Stylus won't be able to take advantage of.\n",
            "It's a strike against the Moto G Stylus but not a dealbreaker.\n",
            "The 5G expansion in the US will be focused on major cities at first, so if you live somewhere more rural, having a 5G device probably isn't a priority now or in the near future.\n",
            "And, if you're otherwise happy with 4G speeds or spend most of your time on Wi-Fi anyway, then you'll be just fine with a 4G device for the next few years.\n",
            "The Moto G Stylus isn't really designed to last much longer than that anyway.\n",
            "There appear to be three cameras on the G Stylus' rear panel, but one of them is a 2-megapixel depth sensor that you can ignore.\n",
            "There's a 50-megapixel f/1.9 standard wide camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 16-megapixel selfie camera.\n",
            "Last year's model had a dedicated macro camera; this time, the ultrawide does double duty as the macro sensor.\n",
            "Overall, the G Stylus' cameras produce well-balanced images without going overboard on color saturation or HDR effects in high-contrast scenes.\n",
            "Both rear cameras do a good job in good lighting, but there's some noticeable noise in images from the 8-megapixel ultrawide taken in moderately low light.\n",
            "There's also some noticeable lag between when you tap the shutter and when it actually takes a photo, which is fairly common for a budget phone.\n",
            "Night vision is helpful in very low light if your subject isn't moving.\n",
            "It doesn't work miracles, but at least this budget phone has a night mode — unlike another I recently reviewed.\n",
            "Video recording is only available at 1080p, which is unusual.\n",
            "(Most phones these days can shoot 4K video.)\n",
            "There's a fairly aggressive crop, too, even if you turn electronic stabilization off.\n",
            "I don't imagine the lack of 4K resolution video will bother a lot of people buying this phone, but 4K is more or less the new standard for high-resolution video, so that's something to note if video is important to you.\n",
            "Otherwise, 1080p clips are just fine, and the smaller file sizes are easier to share anyway.\n",
            "You're not going to find the Moto G Stylus on the shelves at a Verizon or T-Mobile store.\n",
            "The major carriers are far too interested in getting 5G phones into their customers' hands to waste any of that valuable retail space on a 4G device.\n",
            "And it's not all marketing bluster anymore; true 5G really is arriving, and it really will be faster than 4G.\n",
            "But just because the carriers think it's the right time to put a 5G device in your hand doesn't mean you absolutely have to buy one.\n",
            "If you're fine with 4G and will be over the next few years, then the Moto G Stylus is a great deal.\n",
            "That's not even considering its headline feature: the stylus.\n",
            "It's handy, and even if it doesn't get much use, the phone is still well-priced even without it.\n",
            "If you do want something a little more future-proofed, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is a good option while it's still in stock.\n",
            "For the same price as the Moto G Stylus, it offers similar performance and equally good battery stamina.\n",
            "On the downside, its screen is smaller and lower res, it only comes with 64GB of storage, and, of course, there's no stylus.\n",
            "If you're not concerned about future-proofing for the next generation of wireless technology and a big phone with a big screen is just your size, then the Moto G Stylus is the bargain rack deal for you.\n",
            "Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "To actually use the Motorola Moto G Stylus, you must accept:\n",
            "But you also get to decide how Motorola's support works on your phone:\n",
            "After entering your Google account, you are asked to:\n",
            "And you must agree to the following from Google:\n",
            "You'll also need to agree to the following on Google Services:\n",
            "Google Assistant:\n",
            "The carrier may also ask you to agree to some policies and services.\n",
            "Lastly, you have the option to join Motorola's user community:\n",
            "In total, you have to accept five main agreements and can bypass at least 13 when setting up the 2022 Motorola Moto G Stylus.\n",
            "The 10 Pro is OnePlus all grown up.\n",
            "The days of a scrappy upstart challenger are gone — that much was clear with last year's 9 and 9 Pro, with true flagship specs and prices to match.\n",
            "This year, OnePlus has sharpened its vision of a legitimate flagship phone to challenge the big brands, and the result is a sophisticated, sleek device.\n",
            "It's not just a cheaper flagship; it's a real alternative to Samsung and Google, with an identity all its own.\n",
            "That's not to say that OnePlus has entirely closed the gap between itself and the big Android brands.\n",
            "(There was a less expensive version, but it never came to the US.)\n",
            "OnePlus has some work to do to catch up to those competitors in the camera department, for one.\n",
            "And it still hasn't worked things out with AT&T, so there's no support for that carrier's 5G network — just 4G.\n",
            "Those are some major considerations, and they keep me from freely recommending the 10 Pro to just anyone looking for a premium Android phone.\n",
            "But I'm encouraged by the direction the company is taking with the 10 Pro, and if this is indeed the new OnePlus, I like where it's headed.\n",
            "With a 6.7-inch screen, the OnePlus 10 Pro is no doubt a big phone.\n",
            "It features a 1440p LTPO OLED panel that's gently curved on the long edges.\n",
            "Its 20:9 aspect ratio is a hair taller than the S22 Plus and Pixel 6 Pro's displays, and it matches their top refresh rate of 120Hz.\n",
            "Side by side, I can see that the display doesn't get quite as searingly bright as the Galaxy S22 Plus' when they're both exposed to direct sunlight, but it's bright enough to use comfortably, even outdoors.\n",
            "The 10 Pro features an aluminum frame along with Gorilla Glass Victus on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back panel.\n",
            "OnePlus took a page out of Samsung's book and blended the metallic camera bump housing into the side rails of the phone, and it's a good look.\n",
            "They may be cribbing someone else's work, but at least it's one of the smart kids in the class.\n",
            "OnePlus is doing that thing again where the carrier version of the phone — only sold through T-Mobile in the US — has an IP68 rating, but the unlocked version doesn't.\n",
            "OnePlus says there's no build quality difference between the unlocked phone and the one on T-Mobile's shelves.\n",
            "Do with that information what you will.\n",
            "The physical size differences between the 10 Pro and any other big flagship Android phone are small — just a few millimeters in either direction, depending on what device you're comparing it to.\n",
            "That said, it feels a little sleeker and easier to handle, owing partly to that taller screen.\n",
            "It's easier for me to wield than the Pixel 6 Pro, which just feels needlessly chunky the more I use it.\n",
            "The 10 Pro's in-display optical fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive, too, which is an advantage versus the Pixel's slow fingerprint scanner.\n",
            "All around, it's an enjoyable phone to carry and use, even for this small phone fan.\n",
            "The OnePlus 10 Pro uses this year's top Qualcomm chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.\n",
            "At launch, the only variant sold in North America will be the 128GB version with 8GB of RAM — OnePlus says its 256GB / 12GB RAM will be available in the US at a later date.\n",
            "These specs offer plenty of processing power for day-to-day tasks.\n",
            "I noticed some very occasional stutters with heavier tasks like playing Genshin Impact, but for all intents and purposes, this is a speedy device that delivers flagship-level performance.\n",
            "Like any other 2022 flagship phone, the 10 Pro offers 5G connectivity.\n",
            "It's just sub-6GHz 5G, no super-fast millimeter wave (mmWave), which isn't a problem for the vast majority of people.\n",
            "There's full low- and mid-band 5G support on T-Mobile and Verizon, but the 10 Pro doesn't work on AT&T's 5G network, and there's no plan to add support for it at a later date.\n",
            "That means the phone will be stuck on 4G even as AT&T lights up new mid-band spectrum over the next couple of years that should make a big improvement to its 5G speeds.\n",
            "The Galaxy S22 Plus and Pixel 6 Pro both offer full 5G support on all three major carriers with no caveats, so that's a substantial miss for the 10 Pro, especially if you're hoping to use it on AT&T.\n",
            "The 10 Pro includes a big 5,000mAh battery that, in my experience, easily gets me through a day of moderate (and even some heavy) use.\n",
            "Using the Galaxy S22 Plus, I felt like I had to keep an eye on my battery percentage and was down into the single digits by the end of the day.\n",
            "That's not the case with the 10 Pro, though I will qualify that claim by saying that, since I'm on Verizon, I wasn't able to test it on 5G for this review.\n",
            "Prior to its on-sale date, the 10 Pro wasn't certified to use Verizon 5G — just 4G — but that has since changed.\n",
            "I did enable every battery-draining setting I could think of, including the phone's high-performance mode, 1440p screen resolution, Always on Display enabled, and the fastest screen refresh rate available.\n",
            "Even on a day mostly spent off of Wi-Fi, with some 4K video recording and navigation in the mix, I never ended up in uncomfortably low battery percentages.\n",
            "There's more good news on the battery front: the OnePlus 10 Pro supports fast charging, and there's a fast charger provided right in the box.\n",
            "You definitely won't get that with a Samsung or Google phone.\n",
            "In the US, the phone supports 65W charging, while other regions can charge at up to 80W.\n",
            "OnePlus says that this only accounts for a two-minute difference in the total time it takes to charge the phone, and realistically, 65W is plenty fast — just over 30 minutes to bring the battery from 0 to 100 percent.\n",
            "At no point while I was testing this phone did I wish that it would charge faster.\n",
            "All this is to say, you probably won't need to recharge the 10 Pro in the middle of the day unless you spend a lot of time gaming or streaming video.\n",
            "The 10 Pro ships with OnePlus' version of Android 12.\n",
            "It got off to a rough start when it was released for the 9 and 9 Pro, but the launch bugs seem to have been resolved, and I haven't noticed any significant issues.\n",
            "The Shelf is back — that's a home screen page where you can put your widgets and an inspirational message / daily affirmation / quote from a '90s disaster movie.\n",
            "It now features OnePlus' search feature called Scout, which is similar to Spotlight on the iPhone.\n",
            "It's not new new, but this is the first time the feature has appeared in a phone sold in the US.\n",
            "It's a nice way to quickly find contacts, apps, and settings without scrolling through menu pages.\n",
            "I've seen other device makers embrace Android 12's focus on interface customization, but OnePlus doesn't seem as keen on it.\n",
            "With a Pixel or Galaxy phone running Android 12, you can choose a color palette inspired by your wallpaper to apply to system-wide controls and app icons.\n",
            "OnePlus offers a fair amount of personalization options, but they're a little more limited, and they all have more of a “OnePlus” flavor to them.\n",
            "You can have the phone sample colors from a photo in your camera gallery and apply them to a stylized, graphic wallpaper.\n",
            "It's neat but a decidedly different vibe — one that's a little more grown up and a little less playful.\n",
            "OnePlus has boosted its support policy to provide three major OS updates and four years of security updates for the 10 Pro.\n",
            "That's not as good as what Samsung and Google offer, but it's getting closer.\n",
            "Google also promises three major OS updates for its own devices but has extended security support to up to five years.\n",
            "Samsung still offers the best support among Android device makers, with four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates.\n",
            "OnePlus isn't matching that, but it's taking a step in the right direction.\n",
            "There are three rear cameras on the 10 Pro.\n",
            "The fourth cutout on the camera bump belongs to the flash, not a silly monochrome sensor or something like that, thank goodness.\n",
            "There haven't been any major updates to the rear camera hardware compared to the 9 Pro, but the selfie camera is upgraded with double the resolution.\n",
            "This isn't exactly the same camera system as last year, and there are some software-based improvements.\n",
            "There's now an option to shoot in HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format), a compressed still photo format with 10-bit color that Apple has also adopted.\n",
            "It's not on by default, but you can enable it for all three rear cameras.\n",
            "Provided you're viewing a HEIF image on a display that supports it, you'll see a subtle improvement in the range of color it can reproduce compared to a standard 8-bit JPEG.\n",
            "The 10 Pro can shoot 8K video at 24p, albeit with a fairly heavy crop, and offers 4K shooting up to 120p for slow motion.\n",
            "OnePlus has introduced a new RAW shooting mode, too, called RAW Plus, which is accessible in the camera app's Pro mode.\n",
            "It's a computational RAW mode, like Apple's ProRAW and Samsung's Expert RAW.\n",
            "Unlike standard RAW shooting, computational RAW modes include data from multiple frames to give you a final RAW image with more flexibility for post-processing.\n",
            "I'm glad to see it on the 10 Pro, though in the limited testing I've been able to do with it, I'm not seeing the noticeable improvements over standard RAW shooting that I saw using Samsung's version.\n",
            "The RAW Plus file sizes aren't substantially bigger than the standard RAWs either, which leads me to believe it's not compiling a lot more information into that computational RAW file.\n",
            "Maybe this feature is a work in progress.\n",
            "In any case, RAW Plus gives you standard DNG files, so you can tinker with them in any RAW processing software like Lightroom or an app like Snapseed.\n",
            "There are a few more additions to the camera feature set, including three new color filters called Master Styles named for Hasselblad ambassadors, a long exposure mode, and manual exposure controls for video recording.\n",
            "OnePlus has also tweaked its image processing for noise reduction and dynamic range.\n",
            "This list of updates is frankly a little underwhelming, especially considering that OnePlus' camera capabilities were already lagging behind that of Samsung and Google.\n",
            "Samsung's phones now produce some of the best portrait mode photos from any phone, and Google just updated its very good Pixel camera system with all-new hardware.\n",
            "The images I've taken with the 10 Pro are good, and the ultrawide camera is still better than most, but I can't say I'm impressed otherwise.\n",
            "Night mode photos are weirdly over-brightened, and the camera sometimes has a tendency to overexpose images, even in moderate indoor lighting.\n",
            "Portrait mode photos look okay, but side by side with the S22 Plus, it's obvious how much further ahead Samsung is.\n",
            "I hope OnePlus will put a little more effort into the next iteration of its camera rather than relying so much on its Hasselblad partnership to do the leg work.\n",
            "There are a lot of things I like about the OnePlus 10 Pro, starting with the day-to-day experience of using the phone.\n",
            "It just looks nice.\n",
            "Its software is nice.\n",
            "It isn't fussy or loaded with a lot of apps I don't need.\n",
            "It's pleasant to use, like a phone should be.\n",
            "OnePlus has taken another step in the evolution of its flagship offerings, and it's a good one.\n",
            "This feels like a device that knows what it is and who it's for, more so than the 9 and 9 Pro.\n",
            "But it's tough to recommend this phone when the Pixel 6 Pro is right there, at the same price, with full 5G support on every carrier and a much better camera system.\n",
            "Camera quality and 5G compatibility are likely major considerations for someone buying a premium Android phone in 2022, so it's a shame that the OnePlus doesn't measure up in those categories.\n",
            "But there's a likability factor, too.\n",
            "And depending on your priorities, that might be more important than taking better portrait mode photos.\n",
            "The new OnePlus has some more work to do, but it definitely knows how to make a likable phone that feels one of a kind.\n",

            "(No, you won't be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.)\n",
            "Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks.\n",
            "On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.\n",
            "What's different with the iPhone 13's new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it's difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones.\n",
            "The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.\n",
            "Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13's main wide-angle camera has\n",
            "significantly improved.\n",
            "Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional.\n",
            "Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.\n",
            "Video quality is also great.\n",
            "The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you're walking around.\n",
            "It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well.\n",
            "It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.\n",
            "The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage.\n",
            "Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you'll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.\n",
            "For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.\n",
            "Those of us in the US have plenty of phones to choose from in the budget end of the market, but high-end Android phones are looking scarce lately.\n",
            "Thankfully, the options we do have are very good, making this recommendation a close call with the Google Pixel 6.\n",
            "Still, we think that the Galaxy S22 Plus is the best device for most people.\n",
            "The S22 Plus features a big, bright 6.6-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, 2022's Android flagship chipset of choice, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, and three high-quality rear cameras.\n",
            "You don't get the 10x telephoto or the built-in S Pen of the Ultra, but you do get a more spacious screen compared to the 6.1-inch standard S22.\n",
            "It's a comfortable middle ground that's the right configuration of features and size for most people.\n",
            "While the screen and overall performance are excellent, the S22 Plus comes up a little short on battery life.\n",
            "The 4,500mAh cell will last lighter users a full day, but moderate and heavy users who stream a decent amount of video will likely find themselves running the battery down into the single digits by the end of the day.\n",
            "If great battery life is important to you, then look at the Google Pixel 6, which does much better in that department.\n",
            "Samsung's software is still our least favorite part of a Samsung phone, which is more cluttered and contains more duplicate apps than we'd prefer.\n",
            "If you're looking for an alternative that's a little sleeker, the OnePlus 10 Pro is a good option.\n",
            "Just know that it doesn't work on AT&T's 5G network (just LTE), and its cameras aren't quite as good as Samsung's.\n",
            "Otherwise, it's a very nice device that feels a little more sophisticated.\n",
            "Battery and software gripes aside, there's a lot to like about the S22 Plus.\n",
            "The screen is a pleasure to use, the camera system is versatile and dependable, and Samsung's policy of providing up to four generations of OS upgrades is one of the best among Android phones.\n",
            "Its minimalist, understated design has a little more mainstream appeal than the Pixel 6, which isn't actually much bigger but looks and feels bulkier.\n",
            "It may be one of a few truly high-end Android phones offered in the US right now, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a winner only by default; it also happens to be a very good device.\n",
            "Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as the iPhone for photos and videos.\n",
            "This time around, you don't have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.\n",
            "The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple's image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light.\n",
            "If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.\n",
            "The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions.\n",
            "Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability.\n",
            "In addition, the 3x optical\n",
            "zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography.\n",
            "That larger sensor and the fact that it's using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light.\n",
            "You can even shoot and edit videos directly in ProRes on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).\n",
            "We pitted the Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video, and the results are pretty evenly split.\n",
            "While the Pixel 6 Pro's video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro's.\n",
            "The iPhone 13 pro shares the same camera system as the iPhone 13 Pro Max, but in a more compact body.\n",
            "It has a 6.1-inch screen, 128GB of internal storage (up to 1TB), and is powered by the new A15 Bionic processor,\n",
            "The iPhone 13 Pro Max is a beast with an impressive camera system.\n",
            "Weighing a hefty 8.46 ounces, it has a gigantic 6.7-inch OLED screen, the new A15 Bionic chip, and a battery that can handle all the 4K videos you throw at it.\n",
            "The Google Pixel 6 Pro is the larger sibling of the newest Pixel duo, with a 6.7-inch screen, 12GB of RAM, and a third camera featuring a 4x telephoto lens and 48 megapixels of resolution.\n",
            "There's really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it's an important one: if you want a phone that's easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket.\n",
            "The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don't have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.\n",
            "Though it's much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini's 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you're coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious.\n",
            "But it's also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb.\n",
            "You won't need a PopSocket on this one.\n",
            "One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won't last a power user through a whole day without a charge.\n",
            "It's really designed for a lighter user who isn't glued to the phone all day.\n",
            "Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model.\n",
            "If you prefer Android, the Asus Zenfone 8 is a good alternative.\n",
            "It's a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn't work on Verizon, but it's otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.\n",
            "The iPhone 13 Mini has all the features and cameras of its bigger siblings, just in a smaller package.\n",
            "It has a 5.4-inch display, 128GB of storage, a smaller battery, and the same A15 Bionic chip as other iPhone 13s.\n",
            "For small-phone Android fans, the Asus Zenfone 8 is the perfect fit.\n",
            "It has a relatively tiny 5.9-inch display, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a dual camera system (64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide).\n",
            "The “Ultra” moniker in Samsung's Galaxy lineup no longer means you're just getting the biggest phone; now, it means you're getting the biggest phone and everything but the kitchen sink.\n",
            "The S22 Ultra offers no less than five cameras, a huge, bright 6.8-inch OLED with up to 120Hz refresh rate, and, oh yeah, a built-in stylus too.\n",
            "It's more or less the successor to the stylus-centric Note series, but more than that, it feels like the endgame of slab-style smartphone development.\n",
            "At the heart of the S22 Ultra is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset paired with 8 or 12GB of RAM.\n",
            "Performance is, not surprisingly, excellent; you'll rarely see the phone stutter or hesitate, even while running graphics-intensive games.\n",
            "Samsung is also promising up to four generations of OS version upgrades, so the Ultra should remain a very good phone for years to come.\n",
            "The included S Pen stylus pops out of a dedicated silo on the bottom of the phone, and Samsung says it's been improved with lower latency than previous years' S Pens.\n",
            "It's hard to judge a few milliseconds of improvement, but it's certainly responsive and easy to use.\n",
            "You can go deep into the stylus features with handwriting-to-text recognition options and slightly gimmicky “Air Actions” that turn the stylus into a magic wand / remote control combo.\n",
            "Or, you can just scribble notes to your heart's content.\n",
            "The choice is yours.\n",
            "The cameras are largely the same as the S21 Ultra's, plus a couple of software-based improvements.\n",
            "Portrait mode photos look better, with more realistic subject isolation, and you can use night mode with high-res mode or portrait mode now.\n",
            "But the bottom line is that the solid camera system the S21 Ultra offered is still just as good here, including a 10x telephoto that's about the best you'll find on any smartphone, anywhere.\n",
            "With so many power-hungry features piled on the S22 Ultra's battery life is a bit lackluster.\n",
            "It will last a day of moderate use with a little in the tank, but power users may need to keep an eye on battery percentage and top off the 5,000mAh cell toward the end of the day.\n",
            "Fast 45W wired charging makes this a quick job, though.\n",
            "If you know the stylus life is for you, and you'd use a 10x zoom regularly, rather than a handful of times as a curiosity, then look no further than the S22 Ultra.\n",
            "Its specialty features are somewhat niche, if powerful, which is why it's not our overall pick for the best mainstream Android phone.\n",
            "But if you're looking for a phone that can do just about anything, this is the right choice.\n",
            "The S22 Ultra is pricey, but you'd be hard pressed to find another slab-style smartphone that can do everything it's capable of doing.\n",
            "As Google's first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life.\n",
            "You'll also get some uniquely Google features thanks to a new, proprietary processor.\n",
            "Sorry, OnePlus.\n",
            "You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option).\n",
            "For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial.\n",
            "That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you'll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren't worth the money).\n",
            "At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google's first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships.\n",
            "Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks.\n",
            "You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take\n",
            "photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you.\n",
            "The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest Android 12 software with Google's new Material You theming.\n",
            "Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth.\n",
            "Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn't have a telephoto camera.\n",
            "Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple.\n",
            "The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68).\n",
            "Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option.\n",
            "The Google Pixel 6 is the new base model of Google's latest flagship.\n",
            "It features the Google Tensor CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a rear camera with both 50 megapixels for its main wide-angle and 12 megapixels for its ultrawide.\n",
            "Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone?\n",
            "Samsung's third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.\n",
            "The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking.\n",
            "When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone.\n",
            "The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021.\n",
            "Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges.\n",
            "It's too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration.\n",
            "Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos.\n",
            "Due to the Z Flip 3's form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.\n",
            "It's hard to say how durable this foldable screen will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out.\n",
            "Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a foldable phone with a non-foldable price tag.\n",
            "The unique, water-resistant device comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 120Hz display as well as 5G support.\n",
            "Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days.\n",
            "You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S's vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout.\n",
            "The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals'' on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer.\n",
            "It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.\n",
            "While the 20S's camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don't use them for night or macro photography.\n",
            "For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM.\n",
            "By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.\n",
            "It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.\n",
            "This TCL 20S has a bright 6.67-inch 1080p screen, 128GB storage, and a 5,000mAh battery.\n",
            "The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists.\n",
            "The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67).\n",
            "Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G).\n",
            "That's because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now.\n",
            "It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode.\n",
            "It can't hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.\n",
            "One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it'll be first in line for the latest Android updates.\n",
            "Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A.\n",
            "Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.\n",
            "As the mid-range Pixel phone, the Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch 1080p OLED, same best-in-class camera, with IP67 water resistance, and three years of software support from Google.\n",
            "You'll be among the first to experience the latest Android build, like Android 12 that is already released for the 5A.\n",
            "If you've been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.\n",
            "(Microsoft's dual-screen Surface Duo 2 is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.)\n",
            "The Fold 3 is Samsung's third-generation folding phone.\n",
            "Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside.\n",
            "That inside screen makes everything from reading books to\n",
            "browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive.\n",
            "When you're done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.\n",
            "It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don't have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.\n",
            "That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn't come without a significant list of compromises.\n",
            "The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens.\n",
            "While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the durability of its foldable screen and hinge remains an open question.\n",
            "But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones.\n",
            "If you're willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that's unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.\n",
            "The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung's latest attempt at making foldable phones more mainstream.\n",
            "It's expensive, sure, but it's also more durable than previous models and comes with a 120Hz display and support for the once-exclusive S Pen.\n",
            "To qualify for this price cut, you need to activate the phone with a carrier on the day of purchase.\n",
            "One of the first things I bought at the start of the pandemic was a set of adjustable dumbbells.\n",
            "My husband and I both wanted to strength train, but we needed several different weights.\n",
            "He had actual muscles while I had noodle arms.\n",
            "The problem was our apartment couldn't accommodate a full rack.\n",
            "Adjustable dumbbells seemed like a sensible choice.\n",
            "And it was until it wasn't.\n",
            "During a set of chest presses, the pin securing the weight plates broke.\n",
            "I got a 5-pound plate to the face.\n",
            "While the price was certainly one thing I was wary about, it's actually not outrageous.\n",
            "I'll get into it more in a bit, but you could easily spend as much — if not more — on 10 sets of regular dumbbells.\n",
            "That's essentially what you're replacing here, as the iSelect Dumbbells go from five to 50 pounds in five-pound increments.\n",
            "You're also paying a premium for the iSelect's smart features.\n",
            "There are two things that make the iSelect dumbbells “smart.” The first is that these use an electronic locking mechanism, as opposed to pins or end screws.\n",
            "The second is that you can change the weights using voice commands to Alexa.\n",
            "Though, fortunately, you don't have to since there's also a knob that lets you change the weights manually.\n",
            "The dumbbells (or smartbells?)\n",
            "themselves rest in a custom-fitted tray.\n",
            "At the center is the manual knob as well as an LCD display that shows you the current weight.\n",
            "There's also an optional tablet holder that you can screw into the back.\n",
            "The tray itself is relatively compact, measuring 21 x 19 x 16 inches (LWH).\n",
            "I couldn't fit it into my living room, but that's only because I already have another connected fitness gadget in there.\n",
            "It did, however, fit easily in my home office.\n",
            "Most people shouldn't have a problem figuring out somewhere to store the tray.\n",
            "The only requirements are to place it near a power outlet, which isn't usually a consideration when storing dumbbells.\n",
            "You'll also want to be intentional about where you place the tray to begin with.\n",
            "Once you put these babies down, you'll have to move 100 pounds of weight plates if you change your mind.\n",

            "That's even more surprising when you consider that it only supports the baseline SBC Bluetooth codec instead of AAC or the more advanced LDAC.\n",
            "And yet, this speaker sounds excellent.\n",
            "Bose's newest Bluetooth speaker, the SoundLink Flex, offers pristine, detailed sound quality with a surprising amount of bass for its size — all in a rugged design that you can take anywhere.\n",
            "You can expect around 12 hours of battery life, and like many other speakers in this guide, the SoundLink Flex is rated IP67 for dust and water resistance.\n",
            "Bose is very confident it can withstand tumbles and swims.\n",
            "Whether you lay the speaker flat or stand it upright, the Flex will automatically optimize the EQ for either orientation.\n",
            "And it also works better than most as a speakerphone with the help of built-in mics.\n",
            "Not everything about the SoundLink Flex is ideal: its buttons aren't easy to use by feel alone, and it's strange that Bose opted to go with Bluetooth 4.2 instead of a newer version of the spec.\n",
            "But if those are my biggest gripes, it's fair to say that the SoundLink Flex is a winner.\n",
            "It's frankly a little mind-boggling that I'm still writing about the UE Boom 3 in 2022.\n",
            "This speaker was released in 2018, and Ultimate Ears has been coasting on it ever since.\n",
            "Or maybe it's just a testament to how good of a portable speaker the Boom 3 is.\n",
            "Few portable speakers have enjoyed the same popularity as the UE Boom 3.\n",
            "With 360-degree sound, a waterproof construction, and easy controls, it's not surprising this Bluetooth speaker has stuck around for so long.\n",
            "The company considers this the “perfected” take on the cylindrical, 360-degree speaker design that it pioneered with earlier Booms.\n",
            "And with 15-hour battery life, a fully waterproof exterior that floats in swimming pools, and those giant, foolproof volume buttons, the UE Boom 3 still holds up.\n",
            "Its standout feature compared to older models is the Magic Button, which lets you quickly play a specific playlist with a press and hold of the top button.\n",
            "But what's given the Boom 3 such staying power is its simplicity, rugged build, and satisfactory sound.\n",
            "Having drivers fire in all directions makes for an expansive soundstage, even if the Boom 3 can lack the detail and sharpness of some competitors.\n",
            "But as an all-rounder, there's a lot to like.\n",
            "It's important to keep your expectations reasonable if you're looking at buying the Sonos Roam.\n",
            "The company's larger speakers often deliver audio performance that sounds bigger and more spacious than you'd expect, but that's not necessarily true of the tiny Roam.\n",
            "Don't get me wrong: while it's not going to blanket a room with music, it's more than capable of putting out clear, dynamic sound if you're sitting nearby or using it as a shower speaker.\n",
            "The Sonos Roam is a small, very portable Bluetooth speaker that integrates with the company's popular whole-home audio platform.\n",
            "It also supports hands-free voice commands with either Alexa or Google Assistant.\n",
            "The real selling points of the Roam are its smarts and tight integration with Sonos' whole-home audio platform.\n",
            "When at home, the Roam streams music over Wi-Fi, so you're getting better fidelity than Bluetooth.\n",
            "You can seamlessly hand off playback from the Roam to another nearby Sonos speaker with the press of a button, and it's a cheap way of adding a turntable to your Sonos system — so long as your turntable supports Bluetooth.\n",
            "You can also easily group it with other Sonos speakers for multi-room playback.\n",
            "If you want to use the Roam as a smart speaker, take your pick between Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant for hands-free voice commands.\n",
            "Sonos recently released a slightly cheaper Roam SL that omits the built-in microphones.\n",
            "But unless you're adamantly opposed to having mics in your gadgets, I'd steer clear of the Roam SL.\n",
            "If you're looking for something a little more powerful, JBL's Charge 5 is beefier than the UE Boom in terms of both dimensions and audio reproduction.\n",
            "I'm not a fan of JBL putting a super-sized logo on its newest speakers; so much for subtlety.\n",
            "But if you don't mind that aesthetic decision, the Charge 5 ticks off many boxes for functionality.\n",
            "It's a stamina champ with up to 20 hours of continuous playback.\n",
            "Speaking of batteries, a unique trick offered by the Charge 5 is its ability to recharge external devices: there's a USB-A port for topping up your own phone or a friend's as you listen to tunes.\n",
            "JBL's Charge 5 is a powerful Bluetooth speaker with a marathon battery life of up to 20 hours.\n",
            "It also lets you charge your phone through the built-in USB-A port.\n",
            "My main disappointment with the Charge 5 is its mono driver, which has to downmix stereo content.\n",
            "When you're dealing with mono portable speakers, there might be sections of a song or particular instruments that aren't as prevalent as they are on stereo speakers.\n",
            "And since the Charge 5 doesn't sound quite as pristine and detailed as Bose's SoundLink Flex, it's more noticeable here.\n",
            "Sony's SRS-XB43 gives you powerful stereo sound with deep, resounding bass.\n",
            "Plus, you get a light show to go along with the music.\n",
            "This speaker is more than capable of handling the soundtrack to an outdoor party — especially if you enable its Extra Bass mode.\n",
            "Sony's SRS-XB43 is a large Bluetooth speaker that's perfect for parties both indoors and out.\n",
            "The powerful stereo drivers sound great with plenty of bass, and you also get a customizable light show.\n",
            "It also has an aux jack (a rarity among the picks here), so anyone can plug in and play audio if you don't want to deal with Bluetooth.\n",
            "But if you do, the XB43 also supports Sony's LDAC codec, and like JBL's Charge 5, there's a USB-A jack on the back for juicing up your gadgets.\n",
            "The headphone jack is a goner on most phones these days, and sadly the aux input is also increasingly disappearing from many Bluetooth speakers.\n",
            "But this one gives you the best of everything.\n",
            "It weighs six and a half pounds, so this isn't a speaker you'll be casually tossing in your bag.\n",
            "But it's tailor-made for use around the house and for parties.\n",
            "And yes, you can download an app and take full control of the lights.\n",
            "The Clip 4 from JBL is actually a bit larger than I would've expected when looking at marketing images.\n",
            "But the integrated carabiner makes it effortless to attach to your bag, bike, and who knows what else.\n",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by the sound this compact speaker can produce.\n",
            "JBL's Clip 4 is an ultra-portable Bluetooth speaker that, as the name gives away, can be clipped onto just about anything.\n",
            "What's most surprising is how good and clear it sounds despite its small size.\n",
            "The bass is a little recessed, but the Clip 4 puts out clear and crisp mids and treble.\n",
            "Like our other picks, it's rated IP67 for dust and water resistance.\n",
            "Combined with its diminutive size and 10-hour battery life, you're looking at a great speaker for bringing along on hikes or other adventures.\n",
            "At 6.61 pounds, the Sonos Move is a hefty thing to lug around.\n",
            "That's why it's mainly intended to be moved around the house or out to the backyard.\n",
            "It's not what I'd consider convenient, but in exchange for putting up with a much bigger speaker than the Roam, you're rewarded with a substantial sound upgrade.\n",
            "The Sonos Move is a large speaker that's designed to be moved around the house or used outside in the yard.\n",
            "It offers powerful sound and full support for countless streaming apps through the Sonos app.\n",
            "The Move is more than capable of filling a room with resonant audio, and like the Roam, you get your choice of using it like a regular Bluetooth speaker or playing music over Wi-Fi with the Sonos app.\n",
            "With an IP56 dust and water resistance rating, the Move is designed to be weatherproof, and it's able to withstand some bumps.\n",
            "But when you add in extras like hands-free voice controls and automatic Trueplay, the Move has a large bag of tricks that make it a unique choice if you're after a larger, louder speaker.\n",
            "Asus always finds a way to surprise me.\n",
            "It's a company that can produce the elegant ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 gaming laptops — up there with the best in the business in terms of design and thinness.\n",
            "It can also make the Flow Z13, a thin gaming tablet with powerful specs inside.\n",
            "I would say that it's a device made explicitly for gamers, but I know plenty of gamers who wouldn't want to be seen using this thing.\n",
            "Its thick chassis is partially translucent, with multi-colored LEDs shining through, and the enclosure for its display has an angular cut out  — just because!\n",
            "You can even swap between a few included “armor caps” to give your laptop a different look from the back.\n",
            "The 2022 model of the Strix Scar 17 is merely a refresh, with very little of its exterior changed from its predecessors (it still doesn't have a webcam, for example).\n",
            "Most of the focus was on making significant upgrades to its internals.\n",
            "It's a speed machine, with 32GB of fast DDR5 RAM, a powerful Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti graphics card, and Intel's Core i9 12900H processor built-in.\n",
            "And to see all of that power on display (well, depending on the games you play), its 17.3-inch QHD panel has a fast 240Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "This is a laptop where you can easily see the perks of having the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware built in.\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 can be relied upon to play any game at a respectable frame rate.\n",
            "While not necessarily unique to this model, this laptop was more than capable enough to run many of those games well on the Alienware QD-OLED gaming monitor, which has a higher 3440 x 1440 resolution than the Strix's built-in laptop display.\n",
            "This laptop can't go toe-to-toe with the new Razer Blade 17 or Alienware X17, at least in terms of looks.\n",
            "Both feature a thin, impressive design with high-end build materials.\n",
            "But if those qualities don't matter to you, the Strix Scar 17 might be priced more to your liking.\n",
            "So long as you don't mind some of Asus' minor cost-cutting measures, like making its laptop clad in plastic instead of aluminum, and other annoyances like McAfee anti-virus pop-ups, you're getting a lot of power for your money.\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17's design is excessive, in a word.\n",
            "Like previous iterations of this laptop, it's dressed to the nines with RGB LED flourishes.\n",
            "There's a large strip of lights going around the front of the chassis and underneath the wrist rest.\n",
            "The bottom edge of the display features another light strip, diffusing light (somewhat tastefully, actually) on the raised venting component.\n",
            "The ROG logo on the back of the display is lit and so are each of the keys on Asus' mechanical keyboard.\n",
            "Needless to say, you should probably avoid this laptop if you're after something that doesn't have a visible RGB LED at nearly every angle.\n",
            "When viewed from the top-down, the chassis is bisected with a line that divides an all-black, soft-touch section with a smoky translucent section that lets you see a little into the machine, which looks cool.\n",
            "Taking a tour around the laptop, the Strix Scar's keyboard, once again, delivers a brilliant typing experience.\n",
            "The keys are nearly silent, yet they feel tactile and fulfilling to type on.\n",
            "It may take a few days to get accustomed to the keyboard layout, but I'm on board with everything that Asus is going for here.\n",
            "There are dedicated keys raised near the top of the keyboard for volume, and the power button is far enough away from the other keys to not be pressed on accident.\n",
            "There are even four programmable keys that you can customize within Asus' Armoury Crate software that's pre-installed.\n",
            "Asus takes full advantage of the chassis real estate by including a number pad, as well as a generously sized trackpad.\n",
            "The trackpad itself is great, though it doesn't click in on its right side if you lean too much weight on the center of the laptop.\n",
            "This shouldn't be an issue for most people, unless you're someone who leans their weight on the wrist rest.\n",
            "The plastic all around this laptop flexes quite a bit — not to a worrying degree, but it's enough to impact the functionality in this case.\n",
            "Also, the laptop's mostly plastic design creaks sometimes when I pick it up.\n",
            "This isn't something that you'll experience with Razer or Alienware's laptops, though whether that justifies their higher prices will depend on the person.\n",
            "It's worth noting that the Strix Scar 17's build materials don't yield a laptop that's lighter than the competition, but I wouldn't call it heavy.\n",
            "It weighs 6.4 pounds, while Razer's all-aluminum Blade 17 is 6.06 pounds.\n",
            "The X17 can go up to seven pounds.\n",
            "As for port selection, there is a headphone jack alongside two USB-A ports around the left side (down from three in past iterations).\n",
            "On the backside, there's a proprietary power connector, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet jack, an HDMI 2.1 port, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB 4 Type-C ports.\n",
            "Along the right side, there's the Keystone II NFC physical key that can be used to securely log into the laptop, with all Asus account and device settings in tow.\n",
            "Additionally, it can activate a performance mode and a designated app when inserted.\n",
            "Conversely, you can program it to lock the computer or shut down applications when removed.\n",
            "It can also give access to a “shadow drive,” which can be encrypted if you have Windows 11 Pro.\n",
            "This is a feature that I'd expect to see on a business-class laptop, so it's odd to see it included with a gaming laptop.\n",
            "Given how terrible most gaming laptop speakers are, I wasn't expecting one of my favorite things about the Strix Scar 17 would be its speakers.\n",
            "On top of its full-sized keyboard that types like a dream, my music and games sound better played through this laptop's speakers than almost any that I've tested before (on par or slightly below where Apple's speakers are in the 16-inch MacBook Pro).\n",
            "Games have a lot more punch in their sound than what I've experienced with other gaming laptops.\n",
            "The display on the Strix Scar 17 is great while the laptop is plugged in, but a little less so while running off of its battery.\n",
            "That's because there's a feature that gradually dims and brightens the panel depending on what is displayed.\n",
            "It's on by default, but it can be turned off within the Intel Graphics Command Center.\n",
            "Another quirk that's hard to ignore is this laptop's lack of a webcam.\n",
            "Despite adding a webcam to this year's ROG Zephyrus G14, G15, and others, Asus still has a handful of gaming laptops without one — the Strix Scar 17 included.\n",
            "The top bezel seems big enough to house a small lens, so Asus' decision to omit a webcam just feels like a miss.\n",
            "Otherwise, I have no complaints about the display.\n",
            "The configuration that I'm testing has a 17.3-inch QHD IPS panel with a 240Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "It supports 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and its 300 nits of peak brightness make it just bright enough to read when it's basking in natural light from a window.\n",
            "Asus offers a 1080p display option for the Strix Scar 17, but QHD is the right resolution for a 17-inch gaming laptop.\n",
            "4K is still too demanding on even the best mobile hardware.\n",
            "By comparison, QHD isn't as much of a challenge, yet it still looks nearly as good as 4K (not to mention, it looks dramatically better than 1080p).\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 talks a big game about bringing what gamers want, and its specs mostly deliver on that promise.\n",
            "Cyberpunk 2077, currently one of the most system-intensive PC games, can run at almost 50 frames per second with QHD resolution, ultra graphics settings (DLSS on), and ray tracing settings switched on.\n",
            "That result is about 17fps shy of what the 2022 Razer Blade 17's RTX 3080 Ti was capable of.\n",
            "Asus' laptop also put up a respectable performance in Red Dead Redemption 2.\n",
            "At ultra settings (no DLSS) in QHD resolution, it achieved a smooth 65fps, while turning DLSS on yielded a 7fps boost.\n",
            "With every game that I tried to run, the Strix Scar 17 didn't face many obstacles running them at their best settings.\n",
            "Its specs can handle most games without needing to be amped up to the laptop's “performance” or “turbo” modes (the keyboard has dedicated buttons to do this), which boost the clock speeds of the CPU and graphics card, and then amps up the fan speed accordingly.\n",
            "The laptop's fans can get loud, but it's no louder than most other high-end gaming laptops.\n",
            "And even at peak performance, the Strix Scar 17's above-average speakers do an admirable job at hushing the sound of the fans (though, dialogue-heavy games won't fare as well, so use some headphones if that applies to you).\n",
            "Also, on the topic of cooling, only the rear-most components of this laptop become toasty during gameplay, but not so hot that it can't be comfortably used or handled.\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 delivers commendable performance outside of gaming, primarily in creative-focused applications like Adobe Premiere Pro.\n",
            "It ripped through our export test faster than most recent laptops that we've tested, completing its render of our 4-minute, 33-second 4K video file in just two minutes and nine seconds.\n",
            "It also fared very well in the PugetBench suite of benchmarking tools for Premiere Pro, scoring 1,001, which beats every laptop we've tested so far in 2022 aside from MSI's pricier GE76 Raider.\n",
            "It's practically a given that any powerful gaming laptop will have not-so-great battery life.\n",
            "And unfortunately, that's the case here.\n",
            "Its 90Wh battery can last about three and a half hours under normal use, which I define as running a dozen or so browser tabs, music streaming, and a chat app like Slack.\n",
            "On the brighter side, you can recharge this year's Strix Scar 17 via USB-C — up to 100W with a USB-C PD charger.\n",
            "Previous versions of this laptop all but required you to tote around its large and hefty 280W power brick.\n",
            "So long as you don't plan on gaming on the go, USB-C recharging is a viable option.\n",
            "Asus's Strix Scar 17 proves that you don't need to spend a fortune to get access to a fast Intel Alder Lake processor or Nvidia's 3070 Ti mobile graphics card.\n",
            "Though, you'll find many of its best qualities in some of Asus' other high-end gaming laptops that offer better designs.\n",
            "The new ROG Zephyrus G14 likely can't stack up with its power.\n",
            "But its new ROG Zephyrus M16, for example, has similar specs to the Strix, packed into a sharper design that has a webcam.\n",
            "Additionally, it has a taller 16:10 aspect ratio, though slightly smaller screen.\n",
            "While its GPU's total graphics power is likely less than the Strix Scar 17's, the M16 may be a solid alternative if you know you want a powerful Asus laptop.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "As with other Windows computers, the Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup.\n",
            "The mandatory policies, for which an agreement is required, are:\n",
            "In addition, there is a slew of optional things to agree to:\n",
            "That's six mandatory agreements and 14 optional ones.\n",
            "Asus always finds a way to surprise me.\n",
            "It's a company that can produce the elegant ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 gaming laptops — up there with the best in the business in terms of design and thinness.\n",

            "When viewed from the top-down, the chassis is bisected with a line that divides an all-black, soft-touch section with a smoky translucent section that lets you see a little into the machine, which looks cool.\n",
            "Taking a tour around the laptop, the Strix Scar's keyboard, once again, delivers a brilliant typing experience.\n",
            "The keys are nearly silent, yet they feel tactile and fulfilling to type on.\n",
            "It may take a few days to get accustomed to the keyboard layout, but I'm on board with everything that Asus is going for here.\n",
            "There are dedicated keys raised near the top of the keyboard for volume, and the power button is far enough away from the other keys to not be pressed on accident.\n",
            "There are even four programmable keys that you can customize within Asus' Armoury Crate software that's pre-installed.\n",
            "Asus takes full advantage of the chassis real estate by including a number pad, as well as a generously sized trackpad.\n",
            "The trackpad itself is great, though it doesn't click in on its right side if you lean too much weight on the center of the laptop.\n",
            "This shouldn't be an issue for most people, unless you're someone who leans their weight on the wrist rest.\n",
            "The plastic all around this laptop flexes quite a bit — not to a worrying degree, but it's enough to impact the functionality in this case.\n",
            "Also, the laptop's mostly plastic design creaks sometimes when I pick it up.\n",
            "This isn't something that you'll experience with Razer or Alienware's laptops, though whether that justifies their higher prices will depend on the person.\n",
            "It's worth noting that the Strix Scar 17's build materials don't yield a laptop that's lighter than the competition, but I wouldn't call it heavy.\n",
            "It weighs 6.4 pounds, while Razer's all-aluminum Blade 17 is 6.06 pounds.\n",
            "The X17 can go up to seven pounds.\n",
            "As for port selection, there is a headphone jack alongside two USB-A ports around the left side (down from three in past iterations).\n",
            "On the backside, there's a proprietary power connector, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet jack, an HDMI 2.1 port, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB 4 Type-C ports.\n",
            "Along the right side, there's the Keystone II NFC physical key that can be used to securely log into the laptop, with all Asus account and device settings in tow.\n",
            "Additionally, it can activate a performance mode and a designated app when inserted.\n",
            "Conversely, you can program it to lock the computer or shut down applications when removed.\n",
            "It can also give access to a “shadow drive,” which can be encrypted if you have Windows 11 Pro.\n",
            "This is a feature that I'd expect to see on a business-class laptop, so it's odd to see it included with a gaming laptop.\n",
            "Given how terrible most gaming laptop speakers are, I wasn't expecting one of my favorite things about the Strix Scar 17 would be its speakers.\n",
            "On top of its full-sized keyboard that types like a dream, my music and games sound better played through this laptop's speakers than almost any that I've tested before (on par or slightly below where Apple's speakers are in the 16-inch MacBook Pro).\n",
            "Games have a lot more punch in their sound than what I've experienced with other gaming laptops.\n",
            "The display on the Strix Scar 17 is great while the laptop is plugged in, but a little less so while running off of its battery.\n",
            "That's because there's a feature that gradually dims and brightens the panel depending on what is displayed.\n",
            "It's on by default, but it can be turned off within the Intel Graphics Command Center.\n",
            "Another quirk that's hard to ignore is this laptop's lack of a webcam.\n",
            "Despite adding a webcam to this year's ROG Zephyrus G14, G15, and others, Asus still has a handful of gaming laptops without one — the Strix Scar 17 included.\n",
            "The top bezel seems big enough to house a small lens, so Asus' decision to omit a webcam just feels like a miss.\n",
            "Otherwise, I have no complaints about the display.\n",
            "The configuration that I'm testing has a 17.3-inch QHD IPS panel with a 240Hz refresh rate.\n",
            "It supports 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and its 300 nits of peak brightness make it just bright enough to read when it's basking in natural light from a window.\n",
            "Asus offers a 1080p display option for the Strix Scar 17, but QHD is the right resolution for a 17-inch gaming laptop.\n",
            "4K is still too demanding on even the best mobile hardware.\n",
            "By comparison, QHD isn't as much of a challenge, yet it still looks nearly as good as 4K (not to mention, it looks dramatically better than 1080p).\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 talks a big game about bringing what gamers want, and its specs mostly deliver on that promise.\n",
            "Cyberpunk 2077, currently one of the most system-intensive PC games, can run at almost 50 frames per second with QHD resolution, ultra graphics settings (DLSS on), and ray tracing settings switched on.\n",
            "That result is about 17fps shy of what the 2022 Razer Blade 17's RTX 3080 Ti was capable of.\n",
            "Asus' laptop also put up a respectable performance in Red Dead Redemption 2.\n",
            "At ultra settings (no DLSS) in QHD resolution, it achieved a smooth 65fps, while turning DLSS on yielded a 7fps boost.\n",
            "With every game that I tried to run, the Strix Scar 17 didn't face many obstacles running them at their best settings.\n",
            "Its specs can handle most games without needing to be amped up to the laptop's “performance” or “turbo” modes (the keyboard has dedicated buttons to do this), which boost the clock speeds of the CPU and graphics card, and then amps up the fan speed accordingly.\n",
            "The laptop's fans can get loud, but it's no louder than most other high-end gaming laptops.\n",
            "And even at peak performance, the Strix Scar 17's above-average speakers do an admirable job at hushing the sound of the fans (though, dialogue-heavy games won't fare as well, so use some headphones if that applies to you).\n",
            "Also, on the topic of cooling, only the rear-most components of this laptop become toasty during gameplay, but not so hot that it can't be comfortably used or handled.\n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 delivers commendable performance outside of gaming, primarily in creative-focused applications like Adobe Premiere Pro.\n",
            "It ripped through our export test faster than most recent laptops that we've tested, completing its render of our 4-minute, 33-second 4K video file in just two minutes and nine seconds.\n",
            "It also fared very well in the PugetBench suite of benchmarking tools for Premiere Pro, scoring 1,001, which beats every laptop we've tested so far in 2022 aside from MSI's pricier GE76 Raider.\n",
            "It's practically a given that any powerful gaming laptop will have not-so-great battery life.\n",
            "And unfortunately, that's the case here.\n",
            "Its 90Wh battery can last about three and a half hours under normal use, which I define as running a dozen or so browser tabs, music streaming, and a chat app like Slack.\n",
            "On the brighter side, you can recharge this year's Strix Scar 17 via USB-C — up to 100W with a USB-C PD charger.\n",
            "Previous versions of this laptop all but required you to tote around its large and hefty 280W power brick.\n",
            "So long as you don't plan on gaming on the go, USB-C recharging is a viable option.\n",
            "Asus's Strix Scar 17 proves that you don't need to spend a fortune to get access to a fast Intel Alder Lake processor or Nvidia's 3070 Ti mobile graphics card.\n",
            "Though, you'll find many of its best qualities in some of Asus' other high-end gaming laptops that offer better designs.\n",
            "The new ROG Zephyrus G14 likely can't stack up with its power.\n",
            "But its new ROG Zephyrus M16, for example, has similar specs to the Strix, packed into a sharper design that has a webcam.\n",
            "Additionally, it has a taller 16:10 aspect ratio, though slightly smaller screen.\n",
            "While its GPU's total graphics power is likely less than the Strix Scar 17's, the M16 may be a solid alternative if you know you want a powerful Asus laptop.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "As with other Windows computers, the Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup.\n",
            "The mandatory policies, for which an agreement is required, are:\n",
            "In addition, there is a slew of optional things to agree to:\n",
            "That's six mandatory agreements and 14 optional ones.\n",
            "If you're shopping for a gaming headset in 2022, you have a lot of options.\n",
            "While there are some great ones out there, it's easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn't work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that's uncomfortable after a few hours of use.\n",
            "Knowing a thing or two about headphones might aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.\n",
            "For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate via Microsoft's proprietary wireless protocol.\n",
            "They'll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases.\n",
            "Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless USB dongle, it'll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console's TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox.\n",
            "In short, it's best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly (or just buy a wired gaming headset instead).\n",
            "This guide focuses mostly on newer options that you're likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online.\n",
            "Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head, and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.\n",
            "You'll find a few categories below, including the best multiplatform wireless headsets that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock (and likely more products than that), the best Xbox wireless gaming headsets, the best PlayStation wireless gaming headsets, and the best wired gaming headsets that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n",
            "best\n",
            "Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)\n",
            "For some time now, Logitech has been on the cusp of making a gaming headset that's good enough for console gamers, mobile gamers, and PC gamers alike.\n",
            "While this headset likely won't satisfy most enthusiasts because of its lack of a boom microphone (it utilizes beamforming microphones) and its minimal noise isolation, that doesn't take away from the G435 being a lightweight and comfortable delight to use.\n",
            "The G435 ships with a USB-A audio transmitter and is compatible with most platforms that have that port, including PCs, PlayStation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch's dock.\n",
            "It isn't compatible with Xbox, though.\n",
            "I've also had success using a USB-A to USB-C adapter to plug it into my Oculus Quest 2, MacBook Pro, and other devices.\n",
            "The G435's killer feature (aside from its broad compatibility and comfort) is its Bluetooth mode, which lets you connect to a phone so you can remain available to accept calls while you use the headset for something else via the 2.4GHz transmitter.\n",
            "You can also just use them as standard headphones via Bluetooth.\n",
            "It's far from the first device to combine Bluetooth with 2.4GHz wireless, but the G435's lightweight design makes it an easier companion to carry around and use for work and play.\n",
            "Logitech's G435 Lightspeed is a lightweight and comfortable wireless gaming headset that won't break the bank.\n",
            "It's compatible with PlayStation consoles, as well as the Nintendo Switch and PC.\n",
            "It also supports Bluetooth, so you can listen to music or pick up calls while you game.\n",
            "The G435 headset is an evolution of the made-for-PC G733's design but without the futuristic LEDs.\n",
            "Like the G733, it utilizes breathable ear pads, though its plastic headband is wrapped in a layer of fabric.\n",
            "Speaking of plastic, that's mostly what you'll find here.\n",
            "This isn't a robust headset with steel-reinforced arms, like many of our other options below.\n",
            "Yet, when it's on your head, it's comfortable enough that you might just forget about that little detail.\n",
            "The ear cups are mounted to rails that extend from the headband, letting you easily move them around until you find the right fit.\n",
            "And even though one look at its advertising should tell you that these were built for a younger generation, my large head fits comfortably within the range of the G435's sizing.\n",
            "There's no annoying clamping, and these are extremely lightweight, so fatigue wasn't something that I encountered.\n",
            "Sound quality is better than I expected for the price, and I often found myself picking these up just to listen to music.\n",
            "They're also fine for gaming, though they lack the hearty low-end sound and noise isolation you might be looking for (especially if you game competitively).\n",
            "Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)\n",
            "The Epos H3Pro Hybrid is a new favorite if you're okay with spending a little more on a gaming headset.\n",
            "However, in several ways, it's a huge upgrade in terms of comfort, overall build quality, thoughtful design, and sound quality — all while still remaining relatively lightweight at about 311 grams.\n",
            "It's actually similar in appearance and comfort to the company's more affordable H3 Hybrid wired headset, which includes Bluetooth support in addition to its wired connection.\n",
            "But the H3Pro Hybrid cuts the cord (the option for wired is still there, though) and adds other capabilities that make it worth the price hike.\n",
            "The latest wireless gaming headset from Epos brings stellar sound quality, lots of comfort, and dual connectivity via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth.\n",
            "Notably, the H3Pro Hybrid features a switch that toggles active noise cancellation and further reduces the amount of incoming noise from your surroundings.\n",
            "The thick, plush ear cups already do a good job at limiting noise as it is, and ANC takes it a step further.\n",
            "It's difficult to hear much of anything around you when the sound-dampening feature is on, so gamers who need to focus closely on positional sounds should find these to be a great companion (not to mention how handy the feature is for just filtering out noise to focus on work).\n",
            "Outside of that, the H3Pro Hybrid makes good on its price by nailing the fundamentals.\n",
            "The steel-reinforced headband feels strong and flexible, and it offers a staggering amount of sizing options, going far beyond the size that my large head requires.\n",
            "The ear cups clamp down just tightly enough to make a seal with your skin, and there's a generous amount of padding at the headband to keep it from weighing you down.\n",
            "Battery life is good.\n",
            "These support USB-C charging, and with ANC on, they can last around 20 hours per charge or more than 30 hours with ANC off.\n",
            "They sound good out of the box, but the Epos gaming suite software for Windows is necessary for tweaking the equalizer and other sound and mic settings.\n",
            "With a little fine-tuning, I was able to achieve my preferred sound reproduction of somewhere between warm and a reference sound, with just a little bass to give it some pep.\n",
            "The drivers are punchy and balanced, and in addition to gaming, these are a joy to listen to music with.\n",
            "They look, feel, and sound like premium headphones should in this price range.\n",
            "Here's what the microphone on the Epos H3Pro Hybrid headset sounds like(opens a new window)\n",
            "Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter\n",
            "Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.\n",
            "This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller).\n",
            "It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time.\n",
            "You don't have to miss a call while you game thanks to Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Headset.\n",
            "In our review, we found it to be a comfortable, intuitively designed headset that's well worth the price.\n",
            "In addition to working well with Xbox consoles, it can connect to another device simultaneously via Bluetooth.\n",
            "Battery life is fine but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge.\n",
            "While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected.\n",
            "Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.\n",
            "Microsoft's headset doesn't break new ground — it just does a lot right for a reasonable price.\n",
            "There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model.\n",

            "I'm willing to bet that you may not have heard of Victrix, a brand owned by PDP Gaming that's focused on making peripherals suited for e-sports pros and aspiring gamers.\n",
            "Either way, it made a killer wireless headset in the Gambit that I think many people will enjoy.\n",
            "I tested the Xbox version, which has a different chipset.\n",
            "The Victrix Gambit is a wireless gaming headset that nails the fundamentals, with good sound quality and controls that are intuitive to use.\n",
            "Unlike many of the headsets in this guide, the Gambit recharges via Micro USB, which is a drag.\n",
            "It's easy to recommend this headset to people who want to do the least amount of fiddling.\n",
            "I'm no designer, but it's tough to imagine how Victrix could have made the built-in controls any more intuitive.\n",
            "On the left ear cup, there's a mic that turns on when you lower it and mutes when you raise it back upward.\n",
            "That cup also has a button that adjusts between three levels of mic monitoring sensitivity and a rubberized dial for finding the perfect balance of game and chat audio.\n",
            "Over on the right cup, a fantastic volume knob sits alone as the only control.\n",
            "I enjoyed the sound quality as much, if not slightly more, than the Xbox Wireless Headset above.\n",
            "The Victrix Gambit doesn't try too hard to woo with bass or with an overly crisp sound that forgoes warmth.\n",
            "It just sounds good out of the box, and I have no complaints about its performance while tethered to the included USB audio transmitter (alternatively, it can be used wired via 3.5mm).\n",
            "Its mic quality is also better than I expected.\n",
            "Its build quality leans heavily on plastic and leatherette.\n",
            "This alone doesn't negatively impact its comfort, but it didn't feel like it seamlessly fit my head like a glove the way Microsoft's option did.\n",
            "For me, this headset's lack of a USB-C charging port would be a deal-breaker — it uses a Micro USB port for recharging.\n",
            "That aside, there's very little that the Victrix Gambit does wrong, and unlike with Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Headset, the included audio transmitter lets it work with a PC out of the box using the Xbox Wireless protocol (normally, you'd have to purchase Microsoft's own transmitter that doubles as a wireless controller hub).\n",
            "But unless you prefer it aesthetically, it's tough to recommend it over the cheaper Xbox Wireless Headset if you're just gaming on Xbox.\n",
            "Here's what the microphone on the Victrix Gambit headset sounds like(opens a new window)\n",
            "Compatible with PS5, PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch, mobile, Oculus Quest 2\n",
            "It's one of the company's most complete headsets yet in terms of features, connectivity, and comfort.\n",
            "Really, the previous version nailed the comfort already, but this year, it added on more battery life, a game and chat audio dial, and USB-C charging (good riddance, Micro USB).\n",
            "The new Arctis 7P Plus has the same design and comfort of previous SteelSeries headsets, but this newer model boasts improved battery life and USB-C charging, making it easy to use the same charging cable that your DualSense uses.\n",
            "If you've read anything about the older Arctis 7P, that's probably still true about this newer one.\n",
            "It has SteelSeries' signature ski goggle headband that suspends its weight without pressing down.\n",
            "The ear cups rotate to be stored more easily or lay on your chest.\n",
            "It still includes a USB-C audio transmitter (and a USB-A converter), making it compatible with a wide range of devices, including the Oculus Quest 2, Switch, and much more.\n",
            "It's these small additions that elevate this year's model higher in our rankings than before.\n",
            "Also, it comes in black if you prefer that color over white.\n",
            "SteelSeries boosted the advertised battery life from 24 to 30 hours per charge — a claim that it meets.\n",
            "I won't shut up about USB-C charging, and in this case, it really just makes a lot of sense to have since it's the same charging port as the DualSense controller.\n",

            "Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band.\n",
            "It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it's on my head.\n",
            "Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.\n",
            "The Pulse 3D's headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5's Tempest sound engine.\n",
            "Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off.\n",
            "Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5's Demon's Souls to be a great showcase for it.\n",
            "In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear.\n",
            "For a more relaxing experience, Astro's Playroom and Returnal sound great, too.\n",
            "There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems.\n",

            "Samsung has its own take on multitasking that it's built on top of Android's native ability to run two apps side by side in a split-screen mode.\n",
            "On the Tab models, you can split the screen three ways, plus add a floating app on top to view four apps at the same time.\n",
            "It can be a little confusing and cumbersome to use, but no less than the iPad's strange approach to multitasking.\n",
            "Beyond that, Samsung also has its DeX mode, which provides a desktop-like environment to run windowed Android apps in.\n",

            "There are other weird limitations, too, like the inability to use the mouse pointer to select text in the browser or an app — an action I do many times per day as an editor.\n",

            "After years of not seeing a great reason to buy an Android tablet, I have to admit that Samsung has presented a compelling pitch this time around — provided you are already in the Samsung Android ecosystem.\n",
            "The Tab S8 and S8 Plus integrate well enough with other Samsung products, they are excellent hardware on their own merits, and if you have specific use cases that are poorly served by Apple's strict control over iOS, these tablets might just be what you're looking for.\n",
            "Samsung still has some work to do fleshing out its ecosystem, and hopefully, Google's renewed interest in Android tablets will produce better third-party app support (I'm not holding my breath there, though).\n",
            "And it's a bummer that if you have a Pixel or other Android phone, you can't really take advantage of a lot of the integrations Samsung has developed.\n",
            "But I think the biggest hurdle with the Tab S8 and S8 Plus as they are is their pricing.\n",

            "Google's apps tend to be more hit or miss, and productivity apps I rely on, such as Slack and Asana, are just awful stretched-out versions of their phone apps and don't take advantage of the larger screen at all.\n",
            "Obviously, your experience will vary depending on which apps you plan to use, but it's safe to say that Android still has a long way to go compared to Apple's tablet app ecosystem.\n",
            "Samsung has its own take on multitasking that it's built on top of Android's native ability to run two apps side by side in a split-screen mode.\n",
            "On the Tab models, you can split the screen three ways, plus add a floating app on top to view four apps at the same time.\n",
            "It can be a little confusing and cumbersome to use, but no less than the iPad's strange approach to multitasking.\n",
            "Beyond that, Samsung also has its DeX mode, which provides a desktop-like environment to run windowed Android apps in.\n",
            "It's meant to bridge the gap between a mobile operating system like Android and a more traditional desktop one like Windows.\n",
            "Though DeX has its fans (hi, yes, I see you in the comments), I've never been able to get along well with it, and that hasn't changed on the Tab S8.\n",
            "Though Samsung's apps work fine in DeX, many Android apps don't know what to do when they are forced into a windowed mode, with small text, odd layouts, and sometimes they can't even launch.\n",
            "There are other weird limitations, too, like the inability to use the mouse pointer to select text in the browser or an app — an action I do many times per day as an editor.\n",
            "DeX remains an option to use in a pinch, but it's not something I would want to work in for long periods of time.\n",
            "Android does bring some advantages depending on your use case and needs.\n",
            "If you're into streaming games or running gaming emulators, it's much easier to do so on Android than it is on an iPad.\n",
            "You can pair a controller to either Tab S8 model and have a competent portable gaming rig that comes with an excellent screen and very good speakers.\n",
            "On the flip side, Samsung and Android are still behind when it comes to other services that can take advantage of the larger screen.\n",
            "On an iPad, I use Apple News with a News Plus subscription to read a wide variety of paywalled magazines and newspapers for a simple monthly fee — there's just nothing comparable that I've been able to find for Android.\n",
            "Fortunately, the Tab S8 / S8 Plus have access to all of the popular streaming services, including Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Hulu, and more.\n",
            "The big one missing is Apple TV Plus (you can watch it in the browser, but that's a sub-par experience to a dedicated app).\n",
            "After years of not seeing a great reason to buy an Android tablet, I have to admit that Samsung has presented a compelling pitch this time around — provided you are already in the Samsung Android ecosystem.\n",
            "The Tab S8 and S8 Plus integrate well enough with other Samsung products, they are excellent hardware on their own merits, and if you have specific use cases that are poorly served by Apple's strict control over iOS, these tablets might just be what you're looking for.\n",
            "Samsung still has some work to do fleshing out its ecosystem, and hopefully, Google's renewed interest in Android tablets will produce better third-party app support (I'm not holding my breath there, though).\n",
            "And it's a bummer that if you have a Pixel or other Android phone, you can't really take advantage of a lot of the integrations Samsung has developed.\n",
            "But I think the biggest hurdle with the Tab S8 and S8 Plus as they are is their pricing.\n",
            "These are premium tablets with big price tags — especially once you start to add accessories to them.\n",
            "Samsung will likely release some more attractively priced tablets to replace some of its older models, and it has been good about delivering software updates to bring some of these new features to existing devices, though the a company spokesperson declined to comment on future updates when I asked..\n",
            "For now, though, if you want a good Android tablet experience and you aren't interested in living the dual-platform life, the Tab S8 or S8 Plus is about as good as it gets.\n",

            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "For Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 and S8 Plus, there are three mandatory things you need to agree to in order to use the tablet:\n",

            "Finally, if you choose to use the Bixby assistant, there is one mandatory thing and two optional ones:\n",

            "Since I'm on the topic of what comes in the box and what doesn't, Samsung does not include a charging brick with the Tab S8 Ultra, similar to how it has packaged its high-end phones for the past couple of years.\n",
            "The Ultra supports up to 45-watt charging, so chargers from most modern laptops will work fine, though most phone-sized chargers will be a bit underpowered.\n",
            "The last bit of hardware that makes the Ultra unique are its dual wide and ultrawide front-facing cameras, which live in a notch that cuts into the top of the screen.\n",
            "The cameras are fine — about on par with what you get from other tablets and work well enough for video calls (they are also on the correct side of the tablet, something Apple still doesn't get right with the iPad).\n",
            "The notch is also fine — it never once distracted me or blocked me from seeing important information on the screen.\n",
            "Samsung has added a feature that attempts to automatically keep your face in the center of the frame in a video call, similar to Apple's Center Stage.\n",
            "Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well and moves the camera around so much that colleagues of mine asked me to turn it off lest they get sick watching me on a Zoom call.\n",

            "It has Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 paired with between 8 and 16GB of RAM.\n",
            "My main disappointment has been how often tabs reload in the web browser when I've left and come back to them after some time; with this much RAM on tap, I'd expect that not to happen.\n",
            "Oddly, Samsung is not offering a cellular-connected version for the Tab S8 Ultra, which makes it less appealing as a computer for frequent travelers.\n",
            "The thing with the Ultra bringing a bigger screen and a bigger price tag is that it engenders bigger expectations for what you might be able to do with it.\n",

            "The same can be said for countless other apps that aren't developed by Samsung itself.\n",
            "It'd be comical if it wasn't so disappointing.\n",
            "Sure, you can use Samsung's split-screen multitasking to share the screen with one or two other apps, or you can flip over to the windowed DeX environment to layer app windows on top of each other, like what you might get from a Windows or macOS computer.\n",
            "But neither of those things makes the Ultra as easy to use or work on as a Windows tablet or laptop might be.\n",
            "I've detailed my frustrations with DeX's limitations in the Tab S8 review, but all of them are even more frustrating on the Ultra, with its larger size and more productivity-focused pitch.\n",
            "A lot of the things you might expect to be able to do in a windowed desktop environment, such as easily resizing app windows to the vertical height of the screen or selecting text with the mouse cursor, either don't work as expected or are limited compared to actual Windows.\n",
            "It feels very much like a shoe-horned solution to a problem that doesn't go far enough to solving it, and Samsung's development progress on DeX has been painfully slow compared to its advancement in other software areas.\n",
            "There are some things that the Ultra is good at, such as video watching and game streaming or emulation, but it's no better than Samsung's smaller and less expensive tablets at them.\n",

            "The notch is also fine — it never once distracted me or blocked me from seeing important information on the screen.\n",
            "Samsung has added a feature that attempts to automatically keep your face in the center of the frame in a video call, similar to Apple's Center Stage.\n",
            "Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well and moves the camera around so much that colleagues of mine asked me to turn it off lest they get sick watching me on a Zoom call.\n",
            "Inside, the Tab S8 Ultra is the same as the other Tab S8 models, though with the option for more RAM in the higher storage tiers.\n",
            "It has Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 paired with between 8 and 16GB of RAM.\n",
            "My main disappointment has been how often tabs reload in the web browser when I've left and come back to them after some time; with this much RAM on tap, I'd expect that not to happen.\n",
            "Oddly, Samsung is not offering a cellular-connected version for the Tab S8 Ultra, which makes it less appealing as a computer for frequent travelers.\n",
            "The thing with the Ultra bringing a bigger screen and a bigger price tag is that it engenders bigger expectations for what you might be able to do with it.\n",
            "This is a tablet that's as big as a laptop when paired with its keyboard case and comes with a premium laptop-level price tag.\n",
            "And that's ultimately where this tech demo falls short.\n",
            "While the smaller Tab S8 models can skirt by with poorly optimized apps that don't quite make use of their screens, those deficiencies feel much more acute on the Ultra.\n",
            "Take Slack, for example.\n",
            "Slack does not have a tablet-optimized version of its Android app, so when you launch it on the Ultra, the phone app is stretched to fill the vast expanse of the 14.6-inch display.\n",
            "There's no way to view more than one conversation at a time or see a list of your conversations or rooms while you're viewing another.\n",
            "The same can be said for countless other apps that aren't developed by Samsung itself.\n",
            "It'd be comical if it wasn't so disappointing.\n",
            "Sure, you can use Samsung's split-screen multitasking to share the screen with one or two other apps, or you can flip over to the windowed DeX environment to layer app windows on top of each other, like what you might get from a Windows or macOS computer.\n",
            "But neither of those things makes the Ultra as easy to use or work on as a Windows tablet or laptop might be.\n",
            "I've detailed my frustrations with DeX's limitations in the Tab S8 review, but all of them are even more frustrating on the Ultra, with its larger size and more productivity-focused pitch.\n",
            "A lot of the things you might expect to be able to do in a windowed desktop environment, such as easily resizing app windows to the vertical height of the screen or selecting text with the mouse cursor, either don't work as expected or are limited compared to actual Windows.\n",
            "It feels very much like a shoe-horned solution to a problem that doesn't go far enough to solving it, and Samsung's development progress on DeX has been painfully slow compared to its advancement in other software areas.\n",
            "There are some things that the Ultra is good at, such as video watching and game streaming or emulation, but it's no better than Samsung's smaller and less expensive tablets at them.\n",
            "Ultimately, the Tab S8 Ultra is a tablet that's the size of a laptop, mimics a laptop's form factor (especially when paired with its keyboard case), and comes with the price tag of a laptop.\n",
            "But it's far from as capable as a laptop that is more comfortable to use and easier to be productive with.\n",
            "Still, as a tech demo, the Tab S8 Ultra is an interesting thing, and it's possible that Samsung will continue iterating on this idea of an oversized tablet in future generations, much like it has done with the Galaxy Fold line of phones.\n",
            "For now, it's best to wait this out.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "For Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, there are three mandatory things you need to agree to in order to use the tablet:\n",
            "In addition, there are four optional agreements presented when setting up the tablet:\n",
            "Finally, if you choose to use the Bixby assistant, there is one mandatory thing and two optional ones:\n",
            "The final tally is three mandatory agreements to use the tablet, four optional agreements, and three more agreements should you choose to use Bixby.\n",
            "For the Google account and Samsung account, these agreements extend to other products that likely involve significantly more agreements.\n",

            "They promise a brighter image while still maintaining the excellent control over brightness that's been a hallmark of OLED displays.\n",
            "What does that mean practically?\n",
            "The ability to be more accurate with brightness means QD-OLEDS can theoretically produce colors more accurately than traditional OLED displays.\n",
            "So, the reds and greens of nature that might look a little more muted on other displays will feel vibrant and more real on a QD-OLED.\n",
            "It comes down to the quantum dot layer (that's the “QD” in the name), which converts blue light into red and green when needed, without the need for color filters typically used in standard OLED panels.\n",

            "That's not an issue here.\n",

            "Thanks to that 1800R curve, practically any game that puts the player in a world with a grand amount of scale looks phenomenal — especially considering that I'm looking at the AW3423DW from about one foot away.\n",
            "I've used curved gaming monitors before, but this QD-OLED panel's combination of curve and vividness were the missing factors that pulled me further into my games.\n",
            "It might sound cliche, but I feel like I'm really seeing games as their makers intended.\n",
            "But not every game plays nicely with the 21:9 aspect ratio.\n",
            "Sadly for me, that currently includes Elden Ring, which registers the native 3440 x 1440 resolution in its settings but still slaps black bars on the screen to confine it to 16:9.\n",
            "There's a downloaded tool called “Flawless Ultrawide” that can force ultrawide, but you apparently run the risk of getting caught by Elden Ring's anti-cheat system by using it.\n",

            "Glintstone sorcery should look powerful and unwieldy, and it finally does on this display.\n",
            "If you're purely gaming, you may not need to make any adjustments to the color profile, but the out-of-the-box contrast and brightness settings were not suitable for simpler use cases, like using productivity apps — namely Gmail, Slack, or Google Docs.\n",
            "Out of games and in the world of text, the off-whites and grays didn't have the color separation that they should.\n",
            "Everything just kind of blended together.\n",
            "While the out-of-the-box pre-calibrated settings were great for games, I had to create a new calibration profile for simple productivity tasks.\n",
            "It's an annoying extra step — switching between calibration profiles depending on the tasks — but it definitely felt worth it when playing games.\n",
            "HDTVtest has an interesting video about another possible pitfall of QD-OLED (or at least this one) for productivity tasks.\n",
            "According to their analysis, it produces a color fringing effect that can be seen while typing in a word processor or completing a similar task.\n",
            "But that flaw wasn't distractingly noticeable during my testing.\n",
            "Back to the topic of screen settings, I was less than impressed with the on-screen UI of the AW3423DW and its bottom-mounted joystick that's used to move about the interface.\n",
            "It's generally confusing to navigate, and it looks out of place on a high-end monitor.\n",
            "My greatest moments of disappointment with this monitor were when I was trying to outsmart the interface, which commonly makes it harder than necessary to make simple adjustments.\n",
            "The AW3423DW isn't the only OLED that can deliver amazing picture quality, bright colors, and true blacks.\n",
            "You can still use an OLED TV as a gaming monitor.\n",
            "And, if you're someone who watches a lot of movies and TV shows and enjoys console gaming, getting something like LG's 42-inch C2 might actually be the better buy.\n",
            "That's mainly because it has a 16:9 aspect ratio, allowing modern gaming devices, be it a PC, a Switch, or the Xbox Series X or PS5, to fully fill out the screen, in addition to having HDMI 2.1 and 4K 120Hz support for consoles and PC.\n",
            "Plus, LG claims that its latest OLEDs are brighter than ever, but we haven't been able to test them yet ourselves.\n",
            "On the AW3423DW, Microsoft's Xbox Series X or Sony's PS5 consoles are limited to displaying in 16:9 (hello, big black vertical bars on the sides of the picture).\n",
            "(You'll first need to turn on Performance Mode within the PS5's game preset settings.)\n",
            "Needless to say, it's not much fun to play games like that.\n",
            "While this monitor was built to take advantage of all the bells and whistles that Windows has to offer, it can, of course, display a nice-looking picture on macOS computers.\n",
            "Though, it's very much a “results may vary” kind of experience.\n",
            "With my 2019 Intel-based MacBook Pro connected (via a Thunderbolt 3 dock through DisplayPort), the AW3423DW displayed at native resolution, with the option to boost the refresh rate up to 120Hz (175Hz wasn't an option).\n",
            "At the 60Hz and 100Hz options, High Dynamic Range was available as an option when the Alienware was in its HDR Peak 1000 mode, but the picture wasn't noticeably altered by the setting.\n",
            "Things were different once I connected a newer 2021 MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip — and not necessarily in all good ways.\n",
            "While the AW3423DW could go up to 175Hz with this laptop connected, and it could support variable refresh rate (1Hz-175Hz), enabling HDR was never an option.\n",
            "All said, the results could differ if you use, say, a Thunderbolt 4 dock, or a USB-C to DisplayPort for a direct connection to the monitor.\n",
            "But in my testing, I wasn't able to take full advantage of the AW3223DW's features in macOS.\n",
            "The AW3423DW has the slight advantage when it comes to brightness.\n",
            "Standard OLED TVs, like the LG C1 we reviewed last year, can sometimes appear dim because of an Automatic Static Brightness Limiter, a mechanism that's in place to prevent pixels from overheating.\n",
            "In our review, Sean Hollister said the OLED panel got so dim during his non-gaming use that it caused eyestrain.\n",
            "Well, after using this QD-OLED, I can safely say that this isn't an issue here.\n",
            "But that doesn't mean those auto-dimming techniques aren't present; they just aren't as noticeable.\n",
            "This monitor can display a small white window close to or directly on Alienware's claim of 1,000 nits of peak brightness.\n",
            "But expanding it to cover more of the screen will cause it to dim, as is usually the case with OLEDs.\n",
            "This can be seen in both of the AW3423DW's HDR modes: HDR Peak 1000 and DisplayHDR 400 True Black (though True Black generally looks less bright at default settings with less of a dramatic shift in tone as you scale content up and down in size).\n",
            "This dimming effect is especially noticeable if you have two windows side by side in dark mode and switch one over to white, which causes the entire panel to take a noticeable step down in brightness.\n",
            "If you want to get in the weeds, check out the technical analysis from the YouTube channel HDTVtest that shows the AW3423DW dipping to a low of around 280 nits with white taking up the full screen.\n",
            "Compare that to RTINGS's review of the LG C1, which measured 125 nits of peak brightness with a similar test.\n",
            "The QD-OLED's gains are minor but a step in the right direction — especially if you're playing games that have a lot of snow or highlights.\n",
            "One other interesting observation from HDTVtest is that you may notice better contrast and darker blacks with the AW3423DW (and perhaps other QD-OLEDs if they're built the same way) in a dimly-lit room.\n",
            "The monitor's screen coating omits a light-reflecting polarizer, and thus, deep blacks can appear gray if you're using it in a well-lit room.\n",
            "I didn't notice a huge difference in day-to-day usage at The Verge's offices.\n",
            "Blacks still looked inky and deep in a well-lit room, but viewing the display in the dark makes everything look even better.\n",
            "You may be considering Alienware's QD-OLED monitor alongside some other curved monitors.\n",
            "Some of the most popular models are Samsung's 49-inch Odyssey G9 and the newer Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monitors.\n",
            "It'd be a good alternative for people who want way more screen real estate (along with an eye-searing 2,000 nits of peak brightness) if not for a few show-stopping issues that we encountered during our reviews.\n",
            "If you're a gamer, the 32:9 aspect ratio that Samsung used on both the Odyssey G9 and Odyssey Neo G9 could be an immersion-breaker.\n",
            "Even in games that have ultrawide compatibility, we noticed that there was usually stretching around the edges of these monitors.\n",
            "That's less of a knock against Samsung and more on the limited use cases of that ultra-ultrawide screen size.\n",
            "Then, there are the bigger issues.\n",
            "In our Neo G9 review, we noticed off-colored shadows in games as well as instances where the monitor displays horizontal lines when the colors darken.\n",
            "That may not happen with every unit, but it's not an issue that you'll have with the AW3423DW.\n",
            "OLEDs can be a little more sensitive to extended use versus LEDs, and there are a couple of features built into this monitor to safeguard the panel and extend its lifespan.\n",
            "One is a pixel-shifting technique that happens automatically, triggering every few minutes.\n",
            "It shifts all of the screen's pixels in a direction, yet it's hardly noticeable.\n",
            "Then, there's “pixel refresh,” a process that takes about seven minutes to complete.\n",
            "The monitor will ask you to perform it if it's been on for four hours straight.\n",
            "If you decline, it'll perform the feature automatically the next time the monitor enters standby mode should your use exceed four hours.\n",
            "Lastly, the “panel refresh” feature can be manually triggered (it will happen automatically after 1,500 hours of use) to completely refresh every pixel in the QD-OLED.\n",
            "It supposedly takes an hour to run through that process.\n",
            "Despite being a first-generation product, the AW3423DW doesn't feel like one.\n",
            "What's more, it costs less and looks better than many 4K monitors that I've seen.\n",
            "And it lives up to Samsung Display's promises by delivering a brighter picture than we've seen before in OLED TVs.\n",
            "Yet, it may not be the perfect monitor for everyone.\n",
            "Its on-screen display and joystick controls are far less intuitive to use than they should be, and it may take some time to tweak the display's settings to suit your non-gaming needs.\n",
            "It's also lacking in high-end HDMI 2.1 ports for faster refresh rates over HDMI, and its 21:9 aspect ratio means that modern consoles won't fill the whole screen.\n",
            "Admittedly, those are all minor gripes if you know what you're getting into.\n",
            "For being the first (and so far the only) QD-OLED monitor on the market, Alienware's AW3423DW should satisfy a lot of people.\n",
            "If only it were easier to purchase right now.\n",

            "If you're purely gaming, you may not need to make any adjustments to the color profile, but the out-of-the-box contrast and brightness settings were not suitable for simpler use cases, like using productivity apps — namely Gmail, Slack, or Google Docs.\n",
            "Out of games and in the world of text, the off-whites and grays didn't have the color separation that they should.\n",
            "Everything just kind of blended together.\n",
            "While the out-of-the-box pre-calibrated settings were great for games, I had to create a new calibration profile for simple productivity tasks.\n",
            "It's an annoying extra step — switching between calibration profiles depending on the tasks — but it definitely felt worth it when playing games.\n",
            "HDTVtest has an interesting video about another possible pitfall of QD-OLED (or at least this one) for productivity tasks.\n",
            "According to their analysis, it produces a color fringing effect that can be seen while typing in a word processor or completing a similar task.\n",
            "But that flaw wasn't distractingly noticeable during my testing.\n",
            "Back to the topic of screen settings, I was less than impressed with the on-screen UI of the AW3423DW and its bottom-mounted joystick that's used to move about the interface.\n",
            "It's generally confusing to navigate, and it looks out of place on a high-end monitor.\n",
            "My greatest moments of disappointment with this monitor were when I was trying to outsmart the interface, which commonly makes it harder than necessary to make simple adjustments.\n",
            "The AW3423DW isn't the only OLED that can deliver amazing picture quality, bright colors, and true blacks.\n",
            "You can still use an OLED TV as a gaming monitor.\n",
            "And, if you're someone who watches a lot of movies and TV shows and enjoys console gaming, getting something like LG's 42-inch C2 might actually be the better buy.\n",
            "That's mainly because it has a 16:9 aspect ratio, allowing modern gaming devices, be it a PC, a Switch, or the Xbox Series X or PS5, to fully fill out the screen, in addition to having HDMI 2.1 and 4K 120Hz support for consoles and PC.\n",
            "Plus, LG claims that its latest OLEDs are brighter than ever, but we haven't been able to test them yet ourselves.\n",
            "On the AW3423DW, Microsoft's Xbox Series X or Sony's PS5 consoles are limited to displaying in 16:9 (hello, big black vertical bars on the sides of the picture).\n",
            "(You'll first need to turn on Performance Mode within the PS5's game preset settings.)\n",
            "Needless to say, it's not much fun to play games like that.\n",
            "While this monitor was built to take advantage of all the bells and whistles that Windows has to offer, it can, of course, display a nice-looking picture on macOS computers.\n",
            "Though, it's very much a “results may vary” kind of experience.\n",
            "With my 2019 Intel-based MacBook Pro connected (via a Thunderbolt 3 dock through DisplayPort), the AW3423DW displayed at native resolution, with the option to boost the refresh rate up to 120Hz (175Hz wasn't an option).\n",
            "At the 60Hz and 100Hz options, High Dynamic Range was available as an option when the Alienware was in its HDR Peak 1000 mode, but the picture wasn't noticeably altered by the setting.\n",
            "Things were different once I connected a newer 2021 MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip — and not necessarily in all good ways.\n",
            "While the AW3423DW could go up to 175Hz with this laptop connected, and it could support variable refresh rate (1Hz-175Hz), enabling HDR was never an option.\n",
            "All said, the results could differ if you use, say, a Thunderbolt 4 dock, or a USB-C to DisplayPort for a direct connection to the monitor.\n",
            "But in my testing, I wasn't able to take full advantage of the AW3223DW's features in macOS.\n",
            "The AW3423DW has the slight advantage when it comes to brightness.\n",
            "Standard OLED TVs, like the LG C1 we reviewed last year, can sometimes appear dim because of an Automatic Static Brightness Limiter, a mechanism that's in place to prevent pixels from overheating.\n",
            "In our review, Sean Hollister said the OLED panel got so dim during his non-gaming use that it caused eyestrain.\n",
            "Well, after using this QD-OLED, I can safely say that this isn't an issue here.\n",
            "But that doesn't mean those auto-dimming techniques aren't present; they just aren't as noticeable.\n",
            "This monitor can display a small white window close to or directly on Alienware's claim of 1,000 nits of peak brightness.\n",
            "But expanding it to cover more of the screen will cause it to dim, as is usually the case with OLEDs.\n",
            "This can be seen in both of the AW3423DW's HDR modes: HDR Peak 1000 and DisplayHDR 400 True Black (though True Black generally looks less bright at default settings with less of a dramatic shift in tone as you scale content up and down in size).\n",
            "This dimming effect is especially noticeable if you have two windows side by side in dark mode and switch one over to white, which causes the entire panel to take a noticeable step down in brightness.\n",
            "If you want to get in the weeds, check out the technical analysis from the YouTube channel HDTVtest that shows the AW3423DW dipping to a low of around 280 nits with white taking up the full screen.\n",
            "Compare that to RTINGS's review of the LG C1, which measured 125 nits of peak brightness with a similar test.\n",
            "The QD-OLED's gains are minor but a step in the right direction — especially if you're playing games that have a lot of snow or highlights.\n",
            "One other interesting observation from HDTVtest is that you may notice better contrast and darker blacks with the AW3423DW (and perhaps other QD-OLEDs if they're built the same way) in a dimly-lit room.\n",
            "The monitor's screen coating omits a light-reflecting polarizer, and thus, deep blacks can appear gray if you're using it in a well-lit room.\n",
            "I didn't notice a huge difference in day-to-day usage at The Verge's offices.\n",
            "Blacks still looked inky and deep in a well-lit room, but viewing the display in the dark makes everything look even better.\n",
            "You may be considering Alienware's QD-OLED monitor alongside some other curved monitors.\n",
            "Some of the most popular models are Samsung's 49-inch Odyssey G9 and the newer Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monitors.\n",
            "It'd be a good alternative for people who want way more screen real estate (along with an eye-searing 2,000 nits of peak brightness) if not for a few show-stopping issues that we encountered during our reviews.\n",
            "If you're a gamer, the 32:9 aspect ratio that Samsung used on both the Odyssey G9 and Odyssey Neo G9 could be an immersion-breaker.\n",
            "Even in games that have ultrawide compatibility, we noticed that there was usually stretching around the edges of these monitors.\n",
            "That's less of a knock against Samsung and more on the limited use cases of that ultra-ultrawide screen size.\n",
            "Then, there are the bigger issues.\n",
            "In our Neo G9 review, we noticed off-colored shadows in games as well as instances where the monitor displays horizontal lines when the colors darken.\n",
            "That may not happen with every unit, but it's not an issue that you'll have with the AW3423DW.\n",
            "OLEDs can be a little more sensitive to extended use versus LEDs, and there are a couple of features built into this monitor to safeguard the panel and extend its lifespan.\n",
            "One is a pixel-shifting technique that happens automatically, triggering every few minutes.\n",
            "It shifts all of the screen's pixels in a direction, yet it's hardly noticeable.\n",
            "Then, there's “pixel refresh,” a process that takes about seven minutes to complete.\n",
            "The monitor will ask you to perform it if it's been on for four hours straight.\n",
            "If you decline, it'll perform the feature automatically the next time the monitor enters standby mode should your use exceed four hours.\n",
            "Lastly, the “panel refresh” feature can be manually triggered (it will happen automatically after 1,500 hours of use) to completely refresh every pixel in the QD-OLED.\n",
            "It supposedly takes an hour to run through that process.\n",
            "Despite being a first-generation product, the AW3423DW doesn't feel like one.\n",
            "What's more, it costs less and looks better than many 4K monitors that I've seen.\n",
            "And it lives up to Samsung Display's promises by delivering a brighter picture than we've seen before in OLED TVs.\n",
            "Yet, it may not be the perfect monitor for everyone.\n",
            "Its on-screen display and joystick controls are far less intuitive to use than they should be, and it may take some time to tweak the display's settings to suit your non-gaming needs.\n",
            "It's also lacking in high-end HDMI 2.1 ports for faster refresh rates over HDMI, and its 21:9 aspect ratio means that modern consoles won't fill the whole screen.\n",
            "Admittedly, those are all minor gripes if you know what you're getting into.\n",
            "For being the first (and so far the only) QD-OLED monitor on the market, Alienware's AW3423DW should satisfy a lot of people.\n",
            "If only it were easier to purchase right now.\n",

            "We don't necessarily expect the new HX CPUs to buck that trend — these are all about power.\n",
            "Four of the seven chips here have 16 cores and 24 threads (with eight performance cores and eight efficiency cores).\n",
            "The flagship chip, the Core i9-12950HX, is the real beast.\n",

            "And all-day battery life does make laptops on the AMD side like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 much more viable to double as a personal or work device, which is already a tough sell on many portable Intel-powered machines that are getting less than a few hours.\n",
            "That makes the Expertbook a particularly interesting choice.\n",

            "This device, instead, is all about its portability.\n",
            "The Slim 7 Carbon had a 14-inch screen and was 2.37 pounds; the 7i is a 13.3-incher and weighs just 2.13 pounds.\n",
            "That means it will likely be one of the lightest laptops you can buy this season.\n",

            "Those are hard to comment on without more extensive testing, but I didn't see any red flags as I played around.\n",
            "This new release is in tune with a trend we've been seeing in small consumer laptops across the board these past few years: thin is in.\n",
            "Last year's ThinkPad X1 Nano, at 1.99 pounds, was the single lightest laptop Lenovo has ever released and one of the lightest 13-inchers of all time.\n",
            "This year's ThinkPad Z-Series (an entirely new segment of the ThinkPad line that is supposed to be coming out soon) is also hyper-focused on the thin and light build and has compromised for that goal in areas where other ThinkPads generally don't.\n",
            "Elsewhere, the 7i Carbon comes in three color options: “moon white,” “cloud grey,” and “storm grey.” On the inside, the device includes Intel's 12th Gen Core processors, including the Core i5-1240P and the Core i7-1260P.\n",
            "The latter was included in the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 I just reviewed and demonstrated quite good performance and battery life.\n",
            "RAM can be configured up to 32GB with 1TB of storage.\n",
            "I will also note that while the screen is not an OLED one, it did look quite good.\n",
            "I actually asked the Lenovo team if I was looking at a real screen or a picture when I first saw the device from afar because of how crisp it looked.\n",
            "Other interesting releases from Lenovo today include the Yoga Slim 7i Pro X and Yoga Slim 7 Pro X.\n",
            "These devices are much heavier than the Carbon but still fairly portable at 3.5 pounds.\n",
            "And, more impressively, they can pack a discrete RTX 3050 GPU into that chassis.\n",
            "Such a combination isn't unheard of in gaming laptops — models like Asus' ROG Zephyrus G14 and Acer's Predator Triton 300 SE have better GPUs and are not too much heavier — but it is a unique amount of power to see in a compact consumer-facing device.\n",
            "I briefly played around with this as well, and I was surprised to hear how much it weighed since it felt pretty portable.\n",
            "As someone who carries their laptop around quite a bit, I'd rather have it in my backpack than a Triton.\n",
            "The rounded edges, in particular, give it a bit more of an office-y look and feel than some other GPU-equipped options you might find at this size.\n",

            "This one appears to be more business-oriented, coming equipped with AI-powered security features that include “hardware-level encryption engineered to help protect the device from root and ransomware attacks.” (The AI can also automatically adjust fan speed and performance settings, though this sort of thing can sometimes be more annoying than helpful if it doesn't adjust to your preferences.)\n",

            "That might be good news for business customers, but for the rest of us who want slimmer display bezels and a more modern design like the Surface Pro X, then the wait continues.\n",

            "Consumers won't be able to purchase this from a store, and it's really for businesses and schools looking to upgrade older machines.\n",
            "While I've bemoaned the current design of the Surface Pro for a couple of years now, there are some changes inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus that will appeal to many.\n",
            "Microsoft now offers built-in LTE on select models, and the SSD is now removable, much like the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X. Intel's latest processors also promise better performance and battery life.\n",
            "It's nearly everything you'd want from a Surface tablet in 2021, but I still wish it looked like a Surface Pro X with an Intel chip inside.\n",
            "Thankfully, the base model is now the Intel Core i3 version, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.\n",
            "Microsoft has dropped the 4GB of RAM option for the Plus model.\n",
            "Microsoft offers all 11 models in the classic silver option, but oddly the black version isn't available with built-in LTE.\n",
            "Overall, the hardware on the Surface Pro 7 Plus is almost identical to the Surface Pro 7.\n",
            "There's the same 12.3-inch (2736 x 1824) touchscreen with its 3:2 aspect ratio, a single USB-C port, and the regular USB-A port.\n",
            "Microsoft still hasn't made the switch to Thunderbolt 3 or 4 here, so you can't hook this tablet up to an external GPU or use many of the Thunderbolt drives and docks available.\n",
            "The real changes to the Surface Pro 7 Plus can be found inside.\n",
            "Microsoft has moved to Intel's latest 11th Gen processors, and you can pick between Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 variants.\n",
            "I've been testing the Core i5 model, and it has remained cool even when using heavy apps like video or video-editing software.\n",
            "Like other Core i5 Pro 7 models, this has no internal fan, so it's also silent while working.\n",

            "The biggest new hardware addition is built-in LTE, though.\n",
            "It's the first time the Surface Pro lineup has included this for a few years, but unfortunately there's no 5G support.\n",
            "Microsoft is using Qualcomm's older Snapdragon X20 LTE modem inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus.\n",
            "There's a dedicated SIM slot at the side of the device, which replaces where you'd normally find the microSD slot.\n",
            "As England has been in a pandemic lockdown for months, I haven't ventured outside enough to really push the LTE connectivity to its limits, but I didn't find it impacted battery life too much in my limited tests.\n",
            "LTE connectivity is a great option to have on a device like the Surface Pro, especially for those who normally work remotely, visit clients, or just want something to replace really bad Wi-Fi connectivity.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "As with other Windows 10 computers, the Surface Pro 7 Plus presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup.\n",
            "The mandatory policies, for which agreement is required to use the laptop, are:\n",
            "In addition, there are a slew of optional things to agree to:\n",
            "Add it all up and you have two mandatory agreements and eleven optional ones.\n",

            "This is really designed for commercial users to swap out faulty SSDs or to retain corporate data.\n",
            "The SSD is easily accessible from an access door at the rear of the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and a simple SIM tool will open it up.\n",
            "Microsoft's reseller network has started selling SSD kits, with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options, so there's even the option to upgrade storage space here.\n",
            "It's encouraging to see Microsoft make this so easy to do, which makes it far quicker for IT admins to get a machine up and running again.\n",
            "All of these internal hardware changes also mean that Microsoft has managed to squeeze a bigger battery (46.5Wh to 50.4Wh) inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus.\n",
            "The company now promises 15 hours of battery life, compared to the 10.5 hours on the original Surface Pro 7.\n",
            "I haven't noticed any drastic improvements in battery life during normal usage, though.\n",
            "I typically got around seven to eight hours of battery life during my testing, which includes a mix of apps ranging from Chrome, Discord, and Netflix to Adobe Photoshop.\n",
            "If all you're doing is watching videos, then you'll probably see closer to Microsoft's 15-hour promise, but realistically this is still just enough to get you through a regular day of work.\n",
            "I'm still hoping that one day a Surface Pro will reliably hit 10 hours, so I never have to worry about traveling without a charger.\n",
            "I'm still a big fan of the Surface Pro, despite the lack of design changes.\n",
            "Microsoft is clearly catering to a specific audience here, and the Surface Pro 7 Plus has been built for businesses.\n",
            "I hope that means we'll soon see a consumer-focused Surface Pro that mixes everything that's great about the Surface Pro X with the power and performance of Intel's chips.\n",
            "Built-in LTE and removable SSDs are great additions to the Surface Pro lineup, but we've still been waiting years for basics like Thunderbolt 3 support.\n",
            "And while LTE is a great option to have once again, it's odd that Microsoft isn't including more futureproof 5G connectivity.\n",
            "If you're using an older Surface Pro and looking to upgrade, it might not look like a lot has changed over the years, but these subtle hardware changes do make a small difference.\n",
            "Microsoft completely redesigned the inside of the Surface Pro this year to include this LTE support and removable SSDs.\n",
            "I'm just hoping a complete redesign on the outside is on the way.\n",
            "It's still the 2-in-1 to beat, but the Surface Pro could offer so much more.\n",
            "Intel has ended further development of the company's Compute Cards, as confirmed by Tom's Hardware.\n",
            "The credit-card-sized device contained the fundamental guts of a PC — processor, storage, RAM, wireless modem, etc.\n",
            "— and was meant to make it simple for companies to create docking station-like products that could be upgraded as Intel released new versions.\n",
            "You'd just pop out the old Compute Card and insert the latest hardware.\n",
            "Intel first showcased the device at CES 2017.\n",
            "But now the Compute Card story will end after just a single generation of Intel's 7th Gen processors; this modular dream never even made it to its first upgrade hop.\n",
            "“We continue to believe modular computing is a market where there are many opportunities for innovation,” an Intel spokesperson told Tom's Hardware.\n",
            "“However, as we look at the best way to address this opportunity, we've made the decision that we will not develop new Compute Card products moving forward.” Intel says it will continue to sell remaining inventory through the end of this year.\n",
            "The NexDock was one of the first products to embrace Intel's Compute Card.\n",
            "But according to Tom's Hardware, the company behind it might've already seen the end coming.\n",
            "“We just found out that the future of Compute Card is uncertain,” Nex Computer wrote in a blog post earlier this week.\n",
            "Others have also made attempts at this idea: a company called The Hive demonstrated a device it dubbed Amplicity at CES 2015.\n",
            "But despite its continued public optimism about the core idea, Intel seems to have realized that the Compute Card is not the future of PCs.\n",
            "It's already easy to regularly upgrade a desktop, but not so much smaller-screened devices or all-in-ones.\n",
            "Oh well.\n",
            "Back in November, longtime rivals Intel and AMD shocked the computing world when the two companies announced that they'd be teaming up to create laptop chips that combined Intel's Core line of processors with AMD's Radeon graphics.\n",
            "And now at CES 2018, the first fruits of that partnership have been revealed, in the form of a pair of Intel Core i5 and i7 chips powered by discrete AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPUs.\n",
            "Along with the processor and GPU, each unit also has 4GB of HMB2 VRAM onboard, which Intel says should help drastically save space internally for laptops while increasing battery life.\n",
            "The new chips are part of Intel's H-series line of eighth-generation chips, designed to be the most powerful processors that the company offers for laptops.\n",
            "In other words, these are the Intel processors that you'll see in top-of-the-line gaming laptops and professional machines going forward.\n",
            "Intel says that gaming should run two to three times faster on the new chips compared to a three-year-old system with an Intel Core i7 chip and an Nvidia GTX 950M GPU, which one would hope would be true after three years.\n",
            "Intel and AMD have yet to actually announce any laptops from any partners that will be getting the new chips, but given that it's CES, we'll hopefully hear more sometime this week.\n",
            "For the past year or so, I've been on a mission to find the ultimate compact gaming PC, something I could fit on top of my desk and in a bag and still be able to play the latest AAA games without difficulty.\n",
            "Recently, my quest has landed me on the Corsair One, a line of high-end gaming PCs that have surprisingly small cases and form factors.\n",
            "Fortunately, Corsair just released a new version of the One with support for the latest processors from Intel and GPUs from Nvidia.\n",
            "The new version of the One is now available with an 9th Gen Core i9 chip and Nvidia's top-of-the-line RTX 2080 Ti GPU.\n",
            "Those prices certainly reflect the higher costs of Nvidia's GPUs and Intel's processors over what they were a couple of years ago, but there's no getting around the fact that this is an expensive machine.\n",
            "On top of that, you'd have greater flexibility with upgrades: the only things that can be easily swapped on the One are RAM and storage.\n",
            "Upgrading the CPU or GPU, while technically possible, is out of the reach of most people (it's certainly well beyond my abilities), and it's not supported by Corsair.\n",
            "But the thing you pay for with the Corsair One is the meticulous engineering that makes such an overpowered machine possible in such a small enclosure.\n",
            "The reason you can't do much maintenance or upgrading of your own is that most everything inside this box is tailor-made and bespoke.\n",
            "The appeal of the One is it's a fully built gaming PC with the best components available in a surprisingly compact, nearly silent case.\n",
            "It's a machine you can take out of the box, plug in, download your games on, and you'll be playing in as little time as possible.\n",
            "There's no tinkering necessary because Corsair has already done all of the hard work for you.\n",
            "On top of that, it is all encased in a form factor that you can't easily replicate in the built-your-own world.\n",
            "Like Vlad noted in his review of the original, the One offers a console-like hardware experience — complete with a full-system two-year warranty — for PC gaming.\n",
            "Beyond gaming, the One's list of specs makes it an incredibly powerful PC for basically anything you need it to do.\n",
            "It's obviously overkill for my daily productivity needs, but that doesn't mean I didn't appreciate its seemingly endless power and incredible speed while managing dozens of tabs in Chrome and switching between Slack, Twitter, Mail, Word, and other apps I use on a constant basis.\n",
            "Video editors will admire the One's ability to crunch through export times with ease, though, as I'll note later, there are things about the One's design that make it a bit less appealing for creatives than it could be.\n",
            "In terms of exterior design, the new One is very similar to the original.\n",
            "The case is all aluminum and consumes a mere 12 liters of volume, compared to the 35 liters a typical tower might take up.\n",
            "It's still too large for me to fit in a backpack, and it's far too heavy to transport easily, but it is small enough to fit on top of my desk instead of underneath it.\n",
            "There are two RGB LED strips on the front of the tower that can be programmed to a variety of colors or turned off entirely.\n",
            "If you happen to use Corsair's iCUE gaming mice and keyboards, the lights of your peripherals will sync in tandem with the tower.\n",
            "(The One does not come with a mouse, keyboard, or display, you'll have to supply those yourself.)\n",
            "The vertical shape of the One is reminiscent of the Mac Pro, but it's more angular and aggressive, as one would expect from a gaming PC.\n",
            "The airflow of the system is also similar to the Mac's: cool air is drawn in from the sides of the tower and is then forced out the top by a single large fan.\n",
            "This system produces very little noise and has a zero-spin fan setting at idle, which is perfectly silent.\n",
            "I love that.\n",
            "Many times, I had to visually check the fan to see if it was moving to know that it was working as it should; it rarely spins up to an audible level outside of intensive gaming sessions.\n",
            "Internally, the One is built around a custom liquid cooling system with independent coolers and radiators for the CPU and GPU that will activate as necessary.\n",
            "This allows Corsair to cram truly high-end components into such a small case and still maintain acceptable working temperatures, but it's also the reason why upgrading the CPU and GPU is so difficult.\n",
            "The only significant external difference between the first-generation One and the new model is the movement of the ports on the front of the computer from the top to the bottom.\n",
            "Here, you'll find easy-access HDMI and USB-A ports for hooking up a VR rig, as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n",
            "Inside the case, though, Corsair has done a total overhaul, and it claims to have greatly reduced operating temperatures, which my tranquil testing experience confirms.\n",
            "I do wish Corsair had also added a few Thunderbolt 3 ports and an SD card reader to the One (the lone Type-C port on the back of the computer is limited to USB 3.1 speeds), as that would have made this PC way more attractive as a creator's machine.\n",
            "It also lacks support for 10Gb Ethernet, so there's no way to hook up to the fastest portable drives (over Thunderbolt) or connect to a high-speed networked storage system, like many video editing studios rely on.\n",
            "The One definitely has the horsepower to crunch through video exports.\n",
            "It just won't integrate into a studio's editing bay as nicely as it could have if it had those I/O features.\n",
            "The main use for the One is gaming, and the experience is exactly as you might expect from a Core i9 paired with an RTX 2080 Ti: amazing.\n",
            "There's nothing I can really throw at the machine that will cause it to stumble.\n",
            "Games like Star Wars Battlefront II, Battlefield V, and Forza Horizon 4 run well over 60 frames per second at 4K resolutions and ultra settings.\n",
            "Drop down to 1440p, and you'll be able to hit 100 fps or more in virtually any game; 1080p gaming is child's play for the One.\n",
            "Even the new Anthem beta is playable at 4K in its current state.\n",
            "(I assume the final version of the game will be smoother still.)\n",
            "Much like the first generation of the One, this updated version is a very specific type of computer for a very specific customer: someone who wants a high-end gaming PC without any of the hassles or headaches that come with building their own system.\n",
            "Beyond the out-of-the-box convenience, the One is smaller and quieter than a computer built from off-the-shelf components.\n",
            "And since it's Corsair's flagship product, it benefits from dedicated and informed support should you ever need it.\n",
            "The cost for that convenience and design is steep, and even compared to the last model, the One's price tag will induce a double take.\n",
            "And if you're the type of gamer who always wants the best GPU and CPU available, the One's limited upgradability is going to be hard to live with.\n",
            "But if those things don't give you pause, the Corsair One is a strong candidate for the title of the best gaming PC you can currently buy.\n",
            "The One is a terrific example of a maxed-out gaming PC reduced to a third of its size and a fraction of its noise.\n",
            "It doesn't quite match my desires for a truly portable gaming rig — it would need to be a third of its current size and weight for that — but it's still an incredibly impressive machine.\n",

            "But that's changing this summer with an impressive-looking box that will be known as the Razer Tomahawk, a fully upgradable gaming desktop that takes up just 10 liters of volume.\n",
            "While it might look like just an external GPU box at first glance — maybe a better-looking Razer Core?\n",
            "— there's an important reason why this sleek aluminum and tempered glass box can seem so effortlessly small.\n",
            "It's because there's no traditional motherboard or desktop CPU inside, but rather an Intel NUC Element modular computer.\n",
            "It's effectively a swappable brain that contains up to a 45W Core i9-9980HK mobile CPU, cooling, slots for memory and storage, a Wi-Fi 6 radio, lots of ports, and all the headers a motherboard would normally need to power a desktop PC.\n",
            "This leaves Razer to simply design the enclosure, provide a power supply, graphics card, SSD, fans and RAM, load an operating system, and configure it for you.\n",
            "Or Razer could just provide the enclosure by itself and let you do the rest — though we don't have pricing for the case by itself quite yet.\n",
            "Intel will sell the NUC Element boards separately through retailers like Amazon and Newegg, so you can buy them elsewhere and slot them in.\n",
            "The company tells us the full turnkey system will ship this June.\n",
            "It's not quite the modular gaming PC concept that Razer teased in 2014, but it seems far more realistic — assuming Intel keeps making the modules.\n",
            "Intel says it's planning to offer upgrades for at least a couple years, and other partners are on board as well.\n",

            "Ring has announced that it is adding a new privacy dashboard to its mobile apps that will let Ring owners manage their connected devices, third-party services, and whether local police partnered with Ring can make requests to access video from the Ring cameras on the account.\n",
            "The company says that other privacy and security settings will be added to the dashboard in the future.\n",
            "This new Control Center is available now in both the iOS and Android versions of the Ring app.\n",
            "Ring has faced considerable criticism in recent weeks over its security and privacy practices.\n",
            "There have been reports of Ring cameras being “hacked” because owners reused passwords and logins that were obtained by bad hackers in data leaks from other services and didn't have two-factor authentication set up.\n",
            "A Motherboard report detailed a host of other bad security practices in Ring's systems, such as allowing multiple logins from various locations and IP addresses without informing the owners.\n",
            "In a phone interview, Ring founder Jamie Siminoff says the new Control Center takes a lot of the things that Ring is already doing around security and privacy and puts them in a single location for customers to manage, while also adding a few new features on top.\n",
            "One of those new features is the ability to see who is currently logged into the account and log them out right from the app as well as manage third-party apps and services that have access to your Ring account.\n",
            "Other features include the ability to set up two-factor authentication (which Ring has had for some time) from the dashboard.\n",
            "Siminoff says that Ring is continuing to inform its customers of the importance of two-factor authentication on their accounts and will be making it an “opt-out” thing for new account setups, as opposed to the opt-in setup it currently is.\n",
            "But existing customers will not be forced to adopt two-factor on their existing accounts; Siminoff says doing this would require Ring to log everyone out of the system, and it would prevent access to Ring alarm systems and cameras until the customer opens the app, sets up two-factor, and logs back in.\n",
            "Ring currently only supports two-factor authentication through SMS, but Siminoff says the company will be adding other options in the future.\n",
            "In addition to providing more security controls, the new Control Center will tell Ring owners if the company has a partnership with their local police department and manage the ability for police to request video clips.\n",
            "Ring has close relationships with over 600 police departments across the country to provide them with footage from the Ring cameras that are installed by homeowners.\n",
            "These relationships have been a point of criticism for months, as many reports have come out on how police are able to access and use Ring footage and the issues this presents for marginalized communities.\n",
            "Information on what data Ring provides to police was released when Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) asked Amazon (Ring's parent company) for it and then made the company's responses public.\n",

            "There are many questions one could ask about the Avatar-inspired concept car that Mercedes-Benz unveiled Monday night at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show.\n",
            "Why did the company think this was the best way to highlight its sustainability goals?\n",
            "How much of the ideas and technology in the car will ever translate to the road?\n",
            "And why Avatar?\n",
            "But one of the security guards who spent the evening keeping tabs on the crowd had a much simpler query for a Mercedes-Benz employee: “Where are the windshield wipers?”\n",
            "The answer he was given almost doesn't matter, though it had something to do with hydrophobic glass, I think.\n",
            "Instead, the moment was a funny reminder that many people never grasp why concept cars exist, and that's probably something automakers should consider.\n",
            "At the highest level, concepts are supposed to serve a few purposes.\n",
            "They're a playground where an automaker's designers can run wild with ideas that might never make it into a straightforward production car.\n",
            "They act as something of a testbed for the most advanced technologies that an automaker is working on at any given moment.\n",
            "And they can serve as a signpost of where a company eventually wants to take its product lineup.\n",
            "Mercedes-Benz hit most of those points during its hour-long press conference on Monday night, but they were also obscured by the glitz.\n",
            "There were butterfly drones flying around the theater, lots of typical tech event techno music, and the obligatory CES interview with Gary Shapiro.\n",
            "And then there was all of the Avatar stuff.\n",
            "We saw concept art from the Avatar sequel, which is allegedly due out sometime this century.\n",
            "We heard from producer Jon Landau about what his job is like.\n",
            "We were told how Mercedes-Benz wants to become the world's “most loved luxury brand,” like that matters to anyone outside the company's corporate retreats.\n",
            "Then James Cameron came on stage and talked about protecting Gaia, but also about how he thinks it's inevitable that humans and machines will merge, just like the Na'vi did with their banshees.\n",
            "It was a lot!\n",
            "And it's not that Mercedes-Benz lost the plot, exactly.\n",
            "But it did sort of suffer from what you could probably call Big CES Keynote disease.\n",
            "Companies that come here spend a lot of money, time, and resources in securing one of these prime slots on the eve of the show, and so they inevitably try to get as much bang for their buck.\n",
            "Sometimes that results in Intel assembling a menagerie of light-up trampoliners and octadecacopters.\n",
            "Other times it spawns... whatever this was.\n",
            "Mercedes-Benz did the right thing in focusing on one product and, ostensibly, one (grand) message.\n",
            "But it still sort of stretched the whole idea into oblivion.\n",
            "Which brings us back to the windshield wiper question.\n",
            "Maybe that security guard wasn't paying close attention to all the blue-tinted excitement that was happening on stage, and is perhaps he's unfamiliar with the car industry in general.\n",
            "But I'd bet it was more that he was a bit bewildered, much like me or the woman next to me, who at one point gave up and started flipping through her vacation photos on her iPad.\n",
            "Had Mercedes-Benz truly stuck to its pitch — “we want to be green and this Avatar car shows how far we think we could stretch it if the sky's the limit,” essentially — maybe that wouldn't have been the first question on his mind at the end of the night.\n",
            "As for the car, it's a concept, and it looks really rad.\n",
            "You might disagree, and that's kind of the point of these things as design exercises, so that's great!\n",
            "I especially like the scales on the back of the car, which Mercedes-Benz calls ‘bionic flaps.” They make a really soothing noise when they move in unison.\n",
            "Overall, from the outside, I also think you could look at the many concepts Mercedes-Benz has brought to CES over the years and draw a somewhat straight line between them to this car, which is wild considering how different they all feel on their own terms.\n",
            "The interior is cleanly and beautifully designed, I found the way the curves all fit together when viewed from a side profile to be pleasing.\n",

            "I also really enjoyed the feeling of the seats when sat inside a mockup of the cockpit during a sneak preview of the car and its various technologies.\n",

            "Alienware has announced the second generation of its flagship Area-51m gaming laptop, the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "It's largely similar on the outside to the original Area-51m, but the specs are almost completely overhauled on the inside, with 10th Gen Intel processors, new Nvidia GPUs, faster RAM, and better display options.\n",
            "All of those upgrades will be limited to the new R2 model, though.\n",
            "Despite Alienware's goals for future-proofed upgradable parts, the Area-51m has failed to live up to its potential.\n",
            "One of the biggest draws of the Area-51m was the option for user-replaceable parts.\n",
            "Most modern laptops have nearly all of their internal components sealed in place in an effort to cut down on size.\n",
            "But the Area-51m took a different approach.\n",
            "It was big, easy to disassemble, and made it simple to replace nearly every internal component, from RAM to the CPU to the GPU to even the thermal cooling components.\n",
            "The idea was to make something more portable than any other desktop but more customizable than any laptop.\n",
            "Alienware's parent company, Dell, even built its own system for replaceable GPUs in laptops, called DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) to make it easier to upgrade in the future.\n",
            "It's an idea that Dell would later make good on by selling replacement RTX 2070 and 2080 modules for users who had initially bought the less powerful GTX 1660Ti or RTX 2060 cards and decided that they wanted an upgrade.\n",
            "Admittedly, upgrading from one GPU to another within the same family isn't what most people do with gaming PCs.\n",
            "To be fair to Alienware, back when it launched the Area-51m, the company never outright promised that it would offer new GPUs — only that customers would be able to upgrade within the selection of cards already on offer.\n",
            "The company even told The Verge at the time that it'd “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.”\n",
            "But now, with the launch of the Area-51m R2, there are new GPUs that use the DGFF format.\n",
            "According to Dell, the “Area-51m R1 only supports GPU upgrades within its current generation of graphics cards.” In other words: you can upgrade to the already-available RTX 2070 and 2080 through upgrade kits but not the new RTX 2070 Super and 2080 Super options that are shipping with the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "You also can't upgrade the processor in the R1 model to the new 10th Gen chips that are being offered on the R2 model; like the GPU, customers can only upgrade within the existing array of 9th Gen chips that the R1 shipped with, despite the fact that the Area-51m uses standard desktop sockets.\n",
            "Not all of this is on Alienware.\n",
            "Intel, for example, changed the socket specifications for its new 10th Gen desktop chips, making them incompatible with older motherboards that work with the 9th Gen lineup — like the Area-51m R1.\n",
            "But it highlights the limitations of taking a desktop-style approach to a single laptop: desktop PC owners can easily upgrade their motherboards if they want to take advantage of Intel's latest hardware while retaining most (if not all) of their PC's parts.\n",
            "That's not an option that's available to Area-51m owners.\n",
            "It's hard to look at the Area-51m as anything but a failed experiment.\n",
            "The Area-51m was supposed to offer the best parts of desktop gaming PCs and portable gaming laptops in a single device.\n",
            "Instead, with its hefty price tag and limited upgradability, it's ended up as a series of compromises that emphasize the worst limitations of both categories.\n",
            "If you've been looking at the field of gaming laptops for the past couple of years, you've probably noticed that they are getting thinner, lighter, and less conspicuous.\n",
            "Today's gaming laptops are not only capable of playing the latest games at high frame rates, but they can also pull double duty for productivity work just as easily.\n",
            "It is a behemoth that calls back to the time when all gaming laptops were thick, heavy computers that never left the comfort of a sturdy desk.\n",
            "But while the Area-51m is twice as heavy and almost twice as thick as the latest Razer Blade or thin MSI gaming laptops, it does things that those computers just can't.\n",
            "It's more powerful, thanks to a desktop-class processor and full-power mobile GPU, instead of the lower-power Max Q graphics cards and mobile processors found in those other machines.\n",
            "Unlike most, it has a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, with both a number pad and macro keys.\n",
            "But it also has the ability to let you upgrade its primary components when better, faster chips become available.\n",
            "That's just not something you can do with the vast majority of gaming laptops on the market right now — whether they're thin or not.\n",
            "The Area-51m is technically not the first laptop to offer this kind of upgradability.\n",
            "There have been big clunkers of laptops in the past that let you upgrade the CPU, and there's still an upgradeable GPU standard called MXM.\n",
            "To avoid having to use MXM, Alienware's parent company Dell developed its own system for workstations called DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) that allows it to put the latest GPUs on modular boards that can then be swapped out.\n",
            "The Area-51m is the first consumer laptop to make use of this new platform.\n",
            "The Area-51m's design may immediately separate from the rest of the gaming laptop pack, but if it's really going to justify its cost, it needs to be a top performer out of the box.\n",
            "Fortunately for Alienware, it is.\n",
            "It's perhaps best to think of the Area-51m as a “portable desktop,” as opposed to a laptop or truly mobile computer.\n",
            "It's a massive machine, weighing over 8.5 pounds and measuring 1.7 inches at its thickest point.\n",
            "It has two power adapters, which vary in size depending on the internal configuration, but they add at least another few pounds to the total package.\n",
            "This isn't the kind of computer you can just unplug and carry away from your desk; moving it from place to place is a production each time.\n",
            "It's also not the kind of computer you'll be able to use while traveling.\n",
            "Sure, you can bring it from one place to another, but you won't be gaming along the way because that demands two power outlets, and the giant machine is practically unsafe to use on your lap.\n",
            "Even though the Area-51m is far heavier and larger than most modern laptops (gaming or not), it's a pound lighter than the Alienware 17 it replaces, thanks to its new magnesium alloy chassis.\n",
            "The Area-51m's overall design signals a new direction for Alienware, and it will inform other products the company releases in the future.\n",
            "I like it: the matte white (“lunar light” in Alienware's marketing-speak) model I've been using for this review is modern, attractive, and smooth to the touch.\n",
            "But it's not subtle: there's no mistaking this for anything but a gaming laptop, with its multiple alien head logos and various lighting effects.\n",
            "The most prominent design feature is the gigantic rear exhaust, with its hexagonally patterned grates for ventilation, surrounded by a single ring of LED light that makes the whole assembly look a bit like the engine of a sci-fi spaceship.\n",
            "I don't mind the look, but if you want a sleeper gaming rig, this isn't it.\n",
            "In terms of basic specs and layout, the Area-51m has a full-size, non-chiclet keyboard with a number pad, a traditional trackpad with physical buttons (it lights up when you touch it), and a 17-inch display with slim bezels on the sides and top.\n",
            "I'm not the biggest fan of the keyboard or the trackpad — both feel like something that would have been appropriate on a computer a decade ago — but if you're coming from an older Alienware laptop, you'll feel right at home.\n",
            "The keyboard has customizable macro keys and full RGB lighting options, and since most people will instantly plug a gaming mouse into the side of the Area-51m, the trackpad's small size and so-so tracking performance aren't that much of an issue.\n",
            "My biggest complaint is the annoyingly squeaky N key on my review unit, but I have a feeling that is limited to my sample.\n",
            "Still, it's not something I'd want to put up with on a multi-thousand-dollar computer.\n",
            "Alienware offers four different display options with the Area-51m, but they all share the same size and resolution: 17 inches and 1080p.\n",
            "The display on my higher-end review unit is a 144Hz panel with Nvidia's G-Sync tech plus built-in Tobii eye tracking, and it's great for gaming.\n",
            "It's fast, there's little to no ghosting, and its anti-glare finish helps cut down reflections.\n",
            "It's not the brightest screen, especially compared to something like a MacBook Pro, but it's about average for gaming laptops, and it's not like you'll be using this thing outside anyway.\n",
            "I do wish there were higher-resolution options since the Area-51m's hardware is definitely capable of pushing more pixels, but Alienware tells me that there just aren't 17-inch, high-resolution, high-refresh panels with slim bezels available yet.\n",
            "When those components are available, it will make them an option at the time of purchase on the Area-51m, it says.\n",
            "(The display is not something you'll be able to upgrade after the fact.)\n",
            "The Area-51m has the standard set of ports you'd expect on a gaming laptop in 2019: three USB-A 3.1 ports, a Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port, HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, 2.5-gigabit Ethernet, a headset jack, a microphone jack, and Alienware's proprietary graphics amplifier port for an external GPU.\n",
            "That's probably enough ports for the average gamer, but I'd have liked to have seen even more, including an SD card slot.\n",
            "There's a lot of empty space on the Area-51m's chassis that could be used for more I/O, and multiple Thunderbolt 3 ports or an SD card slot would have made the computer much more attractive to the content creators that would use its horsepower for video editing and other tasks.\n",
            "Inside the hulking chassis is a Z390 chipset, with a desktop processor, up to 64GB (four sticks) of RAM, two M.2 SSD slots, a 2.5-inch drive bay, and Dell's DGFF modular graphics card.\n",
            "You can get the Area-51m with a Core-i7 8700 processor and Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU to start, but I think most people interested in this machine will opt for the higher-end (and more expensive) configurations.\n",
            "The model I've been testing has the Core i9-9900K processor, RTX 2080 GPU, 32GB of DD4 2400MHz RAM, two 512GB M.2 SSDs (in a RAID 0 setup for a total of 1TB of fast storage), and an additional 1TB hybrid drive for more storage.\n",
            "It is possible to buy the lower-end configurations and then upgrade down the road — after all, this is a desktop processor and modular graphics card — but that really only makes sense for upgrading to new generations of CPUs and GPUs, not ones from the same generation.\n",
            "The battery inside the Area-51m is a large, 90 watt-hour unit, but that doesn't translate into great battery life.\n",
            "In my tests, I was able to get about 90 minutes to two hours of use between charges for productivity work and closer to 30 minutes while gaming.\n",
            "That means you'll want to carry around both of the Area-51m's power adapters when you bring the computer places, as you'll need both of them for full-power gaming.\n",
            "It is possible to rely on just the smaller, 180W charger for productivity work, but if you're already lugging the Area-51m around, you might as well fully commit.\n",
            "All of those specs and power mean little if the components can't stay cool enough to run optimally, which is the biggest challenge with gaming laptops.\n",
            "Fortunately, the cooling system Alienware developed for the Area-51m is excellent, and it's able to keep both the CPU and GPU at temps well below their throttling points.\n",
            "It's not silent — the fan system is very loud, especially when at full speed — but it's effective, and it lets the Area-51m hit performance numbers that are much closer to what a desktop provides than a laptop.\n",
            "Loud fans are not really unusual for a gaming laptop, and if you're in the market for the Area-51m, you probably expect it.\n",
            "There are powerful speakers up front that can overpower the fan noise, but most people will just want to use a headset while gaming so they don't have to hear the fans at all.\n",
            "You just might not be able to get away with using the Area-51m in a quiet office or library without getting some dirty looks.\n",
            "Playing games is what the Area-51m was designed to do, and it does that job excellently.\n",
            "It is able to play virtually any modern AAA game I throw at it with the graphical settings maxed out and still maintain high frame rates.\n",
            "Even games like Battlefield V and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which have a lot of eye candy and special ray-tracing lighting effects, could be played with virtually every setting turned on and maxed out and the Area-51m still maintains frame rates between 60 and 80 frames per second.\n",
            "That's not quite the full 144Hz that this screen can push, but it's still high enough for a great experience in those games.\n",
            "Competitive shooting games, like Apex Legends, Overwatch, CS:GO, and everyone's favorite, Fortnite, can be played with all of their graphical features enabled at 120 to 144 frames per second.\n",
            "Players that prefer high frame rates over eye candy can configure these games with lower settings and run them at hundreds of frames per second, which is well more than the native refresh rate of the display.\n",
            "If stock settings aren't providing enough power, Alienware's Command Center offers overclocking options for both the CPU and GPU to squeeze even more performance out of them.\n",
            "All of that performance headroom highlights the Area-51m's bottleneck: the display's resolution.\n",
            "I have no doubt that the Area-51m could easily push a 1440p panel or maybe even a 4K display in lots of games, but for the time being, you're limited to 1080p.\n",
            "If you're after the fastest frame rates you can get, you probably prefer a high-refresh rate screen, but if you are more into visual presentation and eye-candy, more resolution is appreciated, especially for non-gaming applications.\n",
            "For now, if you want to game or work at a higher resolution on the Area-51m, you'll just have to use an external display.\n",
            "As it stands, the Area-51m is the most powerful gaming laptop you can buy, and its upgradeable features mean it could remain powerful for years to come.\n",
            "When we opened up the Area-51m ourselves, we found that — while it isn't exactly easy — swapping out the CPU and GPU isn't much different than doing so on an average desktop gaming PC.\n",
            "But there's an asterisk next to all of this: we don't know for sure that the next generation of Intel processors or Nvidia or AMD GPUs will actually fit in this computer or how much those modular graphics cards will cost.\n",
            "Dell has said that if it's possible to physically and electrically fit the chips onto its swappable graphics boards, it will offer upgrade options, but Dell admits it doesn't necessarily know what Nvidia's next plans are.\n",
            "That uncertainty makes it tough to swallow the Area-51m's price because we really don't know if this experiment will last.\n",
            "For the cost of a well-configured Area-51m, you could buy a desktop computer and monitor with similar power and still have enough money left over to buy a more mainstream thin-and-light gaming laptop for when you want to game on the go.\n",
            "The Area-51m is an unrealistic option for most gamers.\n",
            "The kind of gamer who is going to demand this level of performance in a portable machine and put up with all of the compromises and costs necessary to get it is likely a competitive e-sports player or a virtual reality game developer who needs an easier way to transport their desktop to the next trade show.\n",
            "That said, what Alienware has done with the Area-51m is really impressive.\n",
            "Not only does it hit performance marks unmatched by other portable machines, but it doesn't have any glaring issues or show-stopping usability problems that bring it down, other than the obvious compromises with its size and weight.\n",
            "Even just being able to cool these desktop components efficiently enough for them to perform this well in a portable machine is a genuine feat.\n",
            "If you are the type of gamer who wants the ultimate power in a portable machine and are willing to pay any cost to get it, the Area-51m is for you.\n",
            "For the rest of us, I'm hopeful that Dell's plans for upgradability pan out because I'm very curious to see where the Area-51m's ideas on performance and portability go in the future.\n",

            "Alienware needed to fix the gaming laptop.\n",
            "Today's laptops aren't broken, per se — they're thinner, lighter, and more powerful than ever before.\n",
            "But as gaming desktops have become increasingly bombastic and over-the-top, most mobile machines are focusing on the “laptop” side of things over the “gaming” part.\n",
            "So what would it look like if you built a gaming laptop in 2019, one that could not only compete with its desktop counterparts but replace them entirely?\n",
            "Well, it'd probably look like Alienware's new Area-51m, unveiled at CES 2019 as the “world's most powerful gaming laptop.”\n",
            "The Area-51m was designed to usher in both a new era for the longtime gaming PC company as well as the PC gaming world at large.\n",
            "“We told our engineers, ‘‘Go build us a monster, and see what you can do.' And they came back with the Area-51m,” Alienware co-founder Frank Azor tells The Verge.\n",
            "The Area-51m is simultaneously an answer to two problems: the first, that trend I mentioned about manufacturers leaning toward less powerful, more portable gaming rigs like the Razer Blade or Asus Zephyrus S. It's not that those laptops are bad — for some, they strike a much needed balance between work and play as computers that can handle the newest games, but also offer the kind of battery life, design, and performance needed in a daily driver for school or work.\n",
            "(We've been following the trend since 2013.)\n",
            "The other is the fundamental problem with nearly all gaming laptops: unlike their desktop counterparts, no matter how advanced your machine, there's essentially a ticking clock attached that counts down to obsolescence, starting the moment you buy it.\n",
            "Without the ability to upgrade critical parts like the CPU and graphics card, there will come a day when you won't be able to run the latest games.\n",
            "The Area-51m looks to solve both of these issues by borrowing heavily from the desktop PC market's playbook.\n",
            "In fact, it essentially is a desktop PC, right down to support for the same desktop Intel Core processors, only with a battery, screen, and keyboard built in.\n",
            "More importantly, unlike nearly every other gaming laptop out there, the Area-51m is designed to let you swap not only the hard drive, RAM and battery, but the CPU and GPU, too.\n",
            "It's not just lip service: Alienware is serious about letting users take this thing apart just like they would a full-fledged desktop, down to easily removable screws and labeled guides imprinted into the frame of the laptop to help you through disassembly or reassembly (including specs for each screw should you lose track of one along the way).\n",
            "There are pull tabs to help you remove the laptop's delicate cables by hand, without damaging them, and it shows you the exact order you need to turn the screws for the massive CPU / GPU cooler to properly torque it down.\n",
            "Let's be clear — it's not a job you can do without turning a lot of screws and some thermal paste.\n",
            "But it doesn't feel any harder than building a desktop computer.\n",
            "In many ways, Azor views the Area-51m as a way to get back to the company's roots.\n",
            "Technically, “Area-51m” was the name of the company's very first laptop, roughly 17 years ago.\n",
            "“We thought to ourselves, if we were Alienware [in] 2001... what would we do now?”\n",
            "He says the goal wasn't to build something super light or portable or mainstream or with great battery life (more on that in a sec).\n",
            "Instead, the Area-51m is a testament to the kind of product Alienware could create if there were no price constraints or practical limits, one that harnesses the company's extensive experience in the PC gaming space to build the absolute best laptop possible for the fans that have brought them this far.\n",
            "“This is absolutely not a mass-market machine,” says Azor.\n",
            "For those hardcore gamers, there's plenty of firepower.\n",
            "Alienware is offering the Area-51m with Intel's 9th Gen i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K — the fastest gaming CPUs you can buy — along with up to a GeForce RTX 2080, the beefiest GPU for laptops yet.\n",
            "Though Nvidia's newly announced mobile GeForce RTX graphics chips aren't quite as potent as the desktop versions, Azor says the Area-51m uses a full-fat version that's overclockable, too, with framerates within roughly 5 to 10 percent of a desktop graphics card.\n",
            "And if that's not enough horsepower a year from now, we come back to the intriguing idea of swapping those parts out.\n",
            "Due to the customizable nature of the Area-51m, you can technically slot in any Intel chip that's compatible with Intel's Z390 chipset, and the graphics card is theoretically user-upgradable as well.\n",
            "There's a catch, though.\n",
            "Alienware is using its proprietary Dell Graphics Form Factor (DGFF) cards for GPUs in the Area-51m, and since neither Nvidia nor AMD has promised that they'll make future chips compatible with that format, Alienware can't promise future upgrades either.\n",
            "The company thinks it's likely that future GPUs will be small enough and draw little enough power to fit on a DGFF board, but it can't say for sure.\n",
            "Azor says he'd like to bring the DGFF format to future Alienware and Dell G series gaming laptops, which would, in turn, create a larger market for the graphics boards, but he may not be able to justify that either: “If customers don't show demand for it, it'll be a novelty and then it'll fade away,” he admits.\n",
            "But the interest could also come from other PC makers — Azor says he's willing to sit down and talk with Dell's competitors about the possibility of letting them use DGFF cards, too.\n",
            "Even that might not be enough if Nvidia and AMD aren't fully committed, though.\n",
            "There's long been an “MXM” standard that would theoretically allow you to upgrade graphics in laptops, but support was lackluster and consumers have never really been able to just go out and buy an MXM graphics chip.\n",
            "Another thing to be aware of is that battery life isn't expected to be great.\n",
            "The company expects “a few of hours” of regular usage, and “45 minutes, maybe” while actively gaming.\n",
            "The Area-51m has a 90Wh battery, one of the largest you can carry onto an airplane, and still needs two power adapters to run at full speed: a smaller 180W adapter, which is designed to be more portable if you'd like to take your laptop on the go and you don't need maximum performance; and a choice of either a second 180W charger, a 240W charger, or a 330W charger depending on your choice of graphics card.\n",
            "You'll need to use both in tandem to get the full experience because there's just no way around the math: a desktop-class laptop needs desktop-class power, one way or the other.\n",
            "But the different power adapters won't necessarily hold back your upgrade potential — Alienware says it'll ship out whichever power brick you need, and maybe a tech to install it when it sells you a new graphics card.\n",
            "There are also plenty of options for the 17.3-inch 1080p display on the Area-51m, ranging from a basic 60Hz panel to a 144Hz option with Nvidia G-Sync and an integrated Tobii eye-tracking rig.\n",
            "The plethora of choice applies to storage, too, with two PCIe M.2 SSD slots and a hard drive bay offering plenty of options for configuring your storage setup.\n",
            "The Area-51m also offers four RAM slots, with support for up to 64GB of 2400MHz memory.\n",
            "Ports-wise, there are the two aforementioned DC power jacks, a Thunderbolt 3 port, three USB 3.1 ports, HDMI 2.0, Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, and Alienware's Graphics Amplifier port — nice in case swapping out the internal GPU doesn't pan out the way you'd hoped.\n",
            "It's worth mentioning the Area-51m's weight, too: clocking in at 8.54 pounds for a fully configured laptop, it's not exactly light, although the magnesium alloy chassis actually makes it slightly lighter than its predecessor, the Alienware 17.\n",
            "Along with all the impressive internal changes on offer here, the Area-51m also features a wholly new “Legend” industrial design language, which is meant to lead the way forward for the brand with a cleaner, more focused style that cuts down on the aggressive look of older Alienware products.\n",
            "While Alienware's Area-51m to lead the way, expect that design to trickle down to future computers.\n",
            "So even if your next Alienware is something more akin to the thin and lightweight m17 (that the company also just announced at CES), ideally the ethos of the flag that the company is planting here will continue to influence the more mainstream-focused models the market demands, too.\n",
            "That gets you an Intel Core i7-8700 processor, RTX 2070 GPU, 1TB hard drive, 8GB of DDR4 memory, and a 1080p 60Hz screen.\n",
            "It's by no means the full capability of the Area-51m, but the beauty of what Alienware has built here means that, with the possible exception of the display, all of those components are upgradable down the line should you need more power in the future.\n",
            "It's not likely that the Area-51m is going to be a best-seller: the sheer size and price tag mean that there's probably a limited audience, even in the best scenario.\n",
            "But that's not really the point.\n",
            "As Azor comments, “This product is mostly centered around doing the right thing for our customers, something that we were just going to be absolutely proud of and have an absolute blast with.”\n",
            "Based on what we've seen of the sheer spectacle of the Area-51m so far, it looks like they've more than succeeded in that regard.\n",
            "The Verge on YouTube\n",
            "Alienware's Area-51m came onto the laptop scene at the beginning of the year with a big promise: that you'd be able to upgrade nearly every component of the laptop, including the GPU.\n",
            "And this week, Alienware made good on the last part of that promise by releasing its first GPU upgrade kits for the Area-51m.\n",
            "The new kits aren't the biggest update: they're essentially just the Nvidia RTX 2070 and 2080 GPUs that were already offered on the high-end models which were available at launch.\n",
            "That means these kits are less for users looking to squeeze even more power out of their laptops and more for ones who are having some buyers remorse about picking up a less powerful GPU when they first configured their machines.\n",
            "The kits come with three parts: a new GPU built on Dell's DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) specification; a thermal kit for that GPU (the more powerful GPUs need better cooling); and a more powerful charger.\n",
            "Dell is also offering a service where a technician will come by and perform the installation for you, should you not be comfortable taking apart your laptop yourself.\n",
            "But while the GPUs here aren't exactly “new,” it's still a welcome sign for anyone who bought into the Area-51m.\n",
            "The upgrade kits show that Dell is taking its promise of user upgrades seriously, and gives hope that future GPUs might be released for customers to customize their machines going forward.\n",

            "Intel has rolled out its 10th Gen chips to almost all of its laptop lineup at this point, and now, it's time for desktops to get a turn.\n",
            "The company has announced its latest Comet Lake-S processors across its Core i9, i7, i5, and i3 lineups.\n",
            "Leading the range is the new Core i9-10900K, which offers 10 cores, 20 threads, a 125W TDP, boosted speeds up to 5.3GHz, and, according to Intel, it's “the world's fastest gaming processor.”\n",
            "Despite the 10th Gen moniker, like Intel's recent high-performance H-series laptop chips, the new desktop lineup still relies on Intel's 14nm Skylake architecture, which it's been using since 2015, not the 10nm process found in its Ice Lake chips.\n",
            "But the fact that Intel is still using the older process isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the company has been able to continue to refine and build upon its earlier work, allowing for higher core and thread count and faster clock speeds compared to the 2018 9th Gen lineup.\n",
            "(For reference, the top 9th Gen chip was the i9-9900K, with eight cores, 16 threads, a base frequency of 3.6 GHz, and boosted speeds up to 5.0 GHz — all numbers that the i9-10900K has eclipsed.)\n",
            "The new chips reach those faster speeds thanks to new technologies offered on the high-end chips, including its Turbo Boost 3.0 technology and the “Thermal Velocity Boost” (which was introduced on the 10th Gen H-series laptop chips but limited to just the Core i9 chips here) that will increase clock speed when the processor is at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius / 158 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, assuming there's power available.\n",
            "The new chips also support up to DDR4-2933 memory, support for up to 2.5 gigabit Ethernet, and, like the rest of the 10th Gen lineup, they feature integrated Wi-Fi 6 by default.\n",
            "One downside to the upgrade is that Intel is physically changing its socket configuration for the new lineup, so the new Comet Lake chips aren't compatible with Coffee Lake motherboards — something to keep in mind if you're looking to upgrade.\n",
            "The entire Core lineup also features Intel's integrated UHD Graphics 630 (except the F-series variants, which don't offer integrated graphics at all in exchange for a lower price).\n",
            "Along with the more powerful 125W TDP unlocked lineup of processors (which can be found by looking for a “K” appended at the end of the model number), Intel is also debuting regular 65W 10th Gen chips across the i9, i7, i5, and i3 lineups, along with 35W T-series chips (which have a “T” at the end of their model numbers), which feature the same core and thread counts but lower clock speeds for less power-hungry builds.\n",
            "Dell is being sued in California over its claims that its Alienware Area-51m R1 laptop would offer “unprecedented upgradeability,” Tom's Hardware reports.\n",
            "Alienware customer Robert Felter is accusing the company of running a “false and misleading” marketing campaign, in which it promised that the laptop's core components, including the CPU and GPU, could be swapped out for more powerful models.\n",
            "A year later, the Area-51m R1's successor was announced with new components not available as upgrades for the original model.\n",
            "“Consumers were misled by Dell's false and misleading marketing campaign and paid a significant premium for the Area 51M R1 under the incorrect belief that this ‘unprecedented upgradeability' would save them money in the long run by allowing them to upgrade their laptop's Core Components rather than having to purchase an entirely new upgraded laptop,” the suit alleges.\n",
            "Dell announced the Alienware Area 51-m R1 at CES 2019.\n",
            "The laptop offered a variety of 8th and 9th Gen Intel CPU options (including the i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K processors) and graphics cards including Nvidia's RTX 2070 and 2080.\n",
            "However, when the Area-51m R2 was announced the following May, it offered 10th Gen Intel CPUs and new GPUs including the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super not available as upgrades for the R1.\n",
            "If you go back and look at the specific promises Dell made when it announced the original laptop, it doesn't seem to have technically broken any of them.\n",
            "It said the laptop would only support Intel CPUs that used its Z390 chipset, which was compatible with the 8th and 9th-generation processors in the original R1 laptop.\n",
            "However, when Dell announced the R2, the new 10th-generation Intel CPUs used a new 400-series chipset.\n",
            "Considering it was Intel's decision to change its chipset, this decision was arguably out of Dell's hands.\n",
            "Meanwhile, when it comes to upgrades for the laptop's graphics card, Dell told The Verge at the time of the R1's announcement that it'd “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.” Effectively, customers could upgrade a lower end version of the laptop to a higher-end model, but only within the same generation of components.\n",
            "That left customers who bought the top-end model out of luck when a new generation of components rolled around.\n",
            "The suit alleges that Dell should have been aware that Intel and Nvidia's unannounced products wouldn't work with the laptop.\n",
            "It claims Dell works closely with both companies, and that it should know the specs of their products prior to them becoming public.\n",
            "“Yet, despite being in possession of such designs, and with the full knowledge that the design of the Area 51M R1 could not accommodate future NVIDIA and INTEL chipsets, Dell launched a global campaign to mislead the public that the Area 51M R1 was upgradeable,” it says.\n",
            "The question now is whether that means Dell's claims about “unprecedented upgradeability” (which are still live on its website) were misleading.\n",
            "“Dell's advertisement to the public didn't place any restrictions on the upgradeability of the laptop,” Felter's lawyer David W. Kani told Tom's Hardware.\n",
            "“They also never disclosed that those with the highest spec CPU and/or GPU that their device would not be upgradeable.”\n",
            "Dell declined to comment to Tom's Hardware on the lawsuit, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.\n",
            "In the filing, Felter is seeking damages, relief, and attorneys fees for himself and other affected customers.\n",
            "It's upgrade season for Dell's Alienware laptops, with the company's entire lineup of portable gaming machines — the Area-51m, the m17, and the m15 — getting overhauled with updated specs, including Intel's new 10th Gen chips and Nvidia's latest GPUs.\n",
            "For the top-of-the-line Area-51m (officially, the Alienware Area-51m R2, to distinguish itself from the first-generation Area-51m R1 model), that means Intel's newly announced desktop-class 10th Gen CPUs.\n",
            "Specifically, Alienware is offering four processor options on the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "There's the entry-level Core i7-10700 (eight cores, 2.9GHz base clock speed with up to a 4.8GHz boosted speed) and the unlocked Core i7-10700K, which boosts base clock speed to 3.8GHz and boosted speed up to 5.1GHz.\n",
            "For those who need even more power, there's the 10-core Core i9-10900 (2.8GHz base speed and 5.2GHz boosted speed) along with the unlocked Core i9-10900K, Intel's most powerful 10th Gen desktop chip with a 3.7GHz base speed and 5.3GHz maximum boosted speed.\n",
            "Alienware is also offering new GPUs for the Area-51m R2, with a choice between Nvidia's GTX 1660 Ti (with 6GB of memory), an RTX 2060 (with 6GB of memory), an RTX 2070 Super (with 8GB of memory), or an RTX 2080 Super (also with 8GB of memory).\n",
            "There's also the newly added AMD option of the AMD Radeon RX 5700M (with 8GB of memory).\n",
            "Like the original Area-51 R1, the new GPUs will once again be using Dell's DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) modules, which, in theory, allows them to be easily removed and upgraded like a desktop PC.\n",
            "Unfortunately, Dell has confirmed to The Verge that the new GPUs being debuted on the Area-51m R2 won't be compatible with the original R1 model of the laptop.\n",
            "Dell is planning on selling the new R2 GPUs separately in upgrade kits this fall, but they'll only be able to be used by R2 owners to upgrade their new laptops to a better GPU.\n",
            "Alienware has also improved on other aspects of the Area-51m R2.\n",
            "There are even faster RAM options, with 2933MHz DDR4 configurations at up to 64GB (compared to 2400MHz on the old model) or up to 32GB of 3200MHz DDR4 XMP memory.\n",
            "There is also a breathtaking number of different storage options, from NVMe M.2 PCIe SSDs (up to 2TB), combined SSD and hard drive options, and a variety of RAID configurations.\n",
            "There's also two new display options for the 17.3-inch display: a new 300Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time FHD option, and a 4K UHD panel that offers 500 nits of brightness and 100 percent Adobe RGB color gamut.\n",
            "Those two options joining the previous two options: the base FHD 144Hz panel, and the FHD 144Hz that adds Nvidia's G-Sync.\n",
            "The upgrades for the m15 R3 and m17 R3 models are more straightforward.\n",
            "Both laptops are getting upgraded to Intel's 10th Gen H-series laptop chips, with virtually identical configuration options across the board (except for the display size).\n",
            "Both laptops will offer three choices of CPU: the quad-core i5-10300H, the six-core i7-10750H, and the 8-core i9-10980HK, with 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM.\n",
            "Storage options range from 256GB to 2TB of PCIe M.2 SSD storage, with options for up to 4TB in a RAID0 configuration or 4.5TB in a RAID0 Plus setup.\n",
            "There are new GPU options as well: Nvidia's GTX 1650 Ti, 1660 Ti, RTX 2060, RTX 2070, RTX 2070 Super, and RTX 2080 Super.\n",
            "Like the Area-51m R2, there's also a single AMD option, the Radeon RX 5500M.\n",
            "Display options are similar for the two laptops, with both offering 144Hz FHD, 144Hz FHD with G-Sync, and 300Hz FHD options in their respective 15.6-inch and 17.3-inch sizes.\n",
            "There's also a 4K UHD option with Tobii eye-tracking for both laptops: the m15 with a 400-nit OLED panel, while the m17's is a regular LCD (albeit with a brighter 500-nits of brightness).\n",
            "Both laptops will be available starting on May 21st.\n",
            "Lastly, Dell is also upgrading its G-series lineup of cheaper gaming laptops, the Dell G3 and G5.\n",
            "Both are 15-inch laptops and offer the same two processor options: Intel's quad-core i5-10300H and six-core i7-10750H.\n",
            "The cheaper G3 offers GTX 1650, 1650 Ti, 1660 Ti, and RTX 2060 GPU options, with 60Hz or 144Hz display options; the pricier G5 swaps the base GTX 1650 GPU for a more powerful RTX 2070 with Max-Q, and adds a 300Hz display option.\n",
            "And while the G3 can only be configured with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, the G5 supports up to 32GB.\n",
            "Both will also be available starting on May 21st.\n",
            "With new features in the form of stress management (with electrodermal activity monitoring), skin temperature, oxygen saturation while you sleep, and an upcoming Food and Drug Administration-approved ECG-app, it seemed poised to give us the most holistic look at our health of any consumer-facing wearable yet.\n",
            "Unfortunately, after testing the Sense for the past week, the impression I've gathered is that Fitbit tried to do too much in too little time, which results in a smartwatch that feels slightly unfinished.\n",
            "Note: Because of the way Fitbit structured the embargo on reviews, I had far less time to test than would be ideal for this kind of device (just five days).\n",
            "Many of the features of this watch are designed to give you a longitudinal look at your overall health.\n",
            "To evaluate those features, you need to spend upwards of a month using the device.\n",
            "That being said, as this watch is becoming available this week, we felt it appropriate to give you a look at how this watch performs.\n",
            "We may update this review down the road if longer-duration testing proves to garner important insights.\n",
            "Let's start with the display.\n",
            "The Sense's touchscreen is a 1.58-inch OLED (336 x 336 pixels) display.\n",
            "As you'd expect from OLED, it has dark, inky blacks and vivid colors.\n",
            "While the screen is fairly reflective, it's bright enough that I'm able to read it even in direct sunlight.\n",
            "Even though OLED displays are energy efficient, enabling the Always On feature cuts battery life in half, from roughly six days to about three.\n",
            "I opted to do it anyway because, for me, the whole point of wearing a smartwatch is being able to quickly steal a glance at stuff (the time, a notification, your pace on a run, etc.)\n",
            "without disrupting the flow of what you're doing.\n",
            "Additionally, I found that half the time, the display didn't light up when I wanted to, leading me to make increasingly exaggerated “I'm looking at my watch!” gestures.\n",
            "I'd rather take the hit on battery life.\n",
            "I also found that the touchscreen isn't nearly as responsive as I would like.\n",
            "I would frequently have to re-tap or swipe.\n",
            "The watch seems to get a bit overwhelmed, and there is stuttering in animations when making gestures.\n",
            "This just makes the whole experience less fluid than it ought to be.\n",
            "The watch itself looks not unlike an Apple Watch, which isn't a bad thing.\n",
            "There is a variety of bands to choose from (I tested it with a standard silicone strap as well as a soft leather band), which you can easily swap out in just a few seconds — a marked improvement over the Versa's difficult-to-change straps — and the watch looks good with just about anything you might wear, from a tuxedo to ratty gym clothes.\n",
            "The easiest way to tell the Sense from the Apple Watch is that instead of the dial the Apple Watch has on the right side, the Sense has a “solid-state button” on the left.\n",
            "It is, essentially a small, sunken area with capacitive sensing.\n",
            "When you press it with your finger, the watch vibrates, giving you the impression that you've pushed a button, even though nothing has physically moved.\n",
            "A single press takes you back to the home screen, a long press can be programmed to open your favorite app (by default it opens Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant), and a double-press will open a shortcut to your four favorite apps.\n",
            "I do not like this solid-state button.\n",
            "Unless you cover the entire button with your finger or thumb when pressing it, it won't register, which leads to a lot of fiddling.\n",
            "Do you know what rarely suffers this kind of problem?\n",
            "A normal button.\n",
            "Another issue is that at certain angles the left side of the watch will just happen to press into the flesh of my forearm, which the Sense kept reading as a long-press, and so Alexa was constantly popping up and listening for a command.\n",
            "It happened so often that I eventually disabled long-pressing all together.\n",
            "Not ideal!\n",
            "The whole promise of smartwatches is increased convenience, so anything that's even a little inconvenient is especially galling.\n",
            "The Sense is equipped with GPS, which can be used for more accurate tracking of things like runs, hikes, and bike rides.\n",
            "I found the GPS to be as accurate as I needed, and it did a good job of tracking me even among the tall buildings of Manhattan (which is a nasty test for GPS watches).\n",
            "The Sense boasts improved heart rate tracking with its PurePulse 2.0 technology, which uses a new multi-path heart rate sensor.\n",
            "Basically, that means it's checking your heart rate in more ways and in more places, which, when combined, should provide a more accurate picture of what your heart is doing.\n",
            "This is something I would have liked to spend more time testing, but early results were promising.\n",
            "I would spike my heart rate doing some exercise and then would manually count my beats per minute using a stopwatch and compare it to the Sense.\n",
            "Not only did the Sense generally stay within a few BPM of my manual count, but it would usually get up to speed faster than the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar, which seemed to have a bit more lag.\n",
            "One of the banner features here is an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor and on-watch scanning app.\n",
            "EDA is something that happens primarily in the sweat glands in your skin, and it's a part of your body's sympathetic nervous system.\n",
            "This is still actively being researched, but there is a lot of evidence to support the theory that when you are stressed out, your body is more likely to produce an EDA “event.” The way it works on the Sense is you start the EDA Scan app, and choose whether you want to do a two-minute Quick Scan or a Guided Session up to 60 minutes.\n",
            "In either case, you then sit quietly, attempt to relax, and cover the entire screen of the device with your opposite hand, making sure that the flesh of your palm is touching all four sides of the device.\n",
            "Basically, what we're looking at here is meditation with metrics.\n",
            "In the half-dozen meditations I did, I found that it typically showed I would have one or two EDA events early on, and then I'd be clear for the rest of my session, even though my heart rate would fluctuate up and down as much as 20 BPM.\n",
            "This makes some sense, as it typically takes me a few minutes to relax and settle into a meditation.\n",
            "Those sessions were mostly over the weekend.\n",
            "Then, on Monday morning, I did a 7-minute session and had a whopping 10 EDA events, and I was indeed feeling vastly more stressed-out.\n",
            "So it seems like it did a pretty fair job of gathering metrics on my stress levels while meditating.\n",
            "What one is supposed to do with these metrics, however, is not entirely clear.\n",
            "But let's circle back to that in a minute.\n",
            "The other big, new metrics you get with the Sense are Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Skin Temperature.\n",
            "Both of these readings are taken as you sleep.\n",
            "You may only be newly familiar with Oxygen Saturation because much has been made about it (and with very good reason) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where a drop in your pulse ox could signify a serious problem.\n",
            "The weird thing is that, currently, your Oxygen Saturation is only recorded if you select the SpO2 watchface.\n",
            "That watchface is fine, but it isn't my favorite, which meant that I had to remember to switch my watchface to SpO2 every night before I fell asleep or I wouldn't get a reading, which I didn't always remember to do.\n",
            "This seems unnecessary, especially since you have to go into the app on your phone to dig into that data anyway.\n",
            "As for skin temp, it takes three days to establish an average, and from then on, it will tell you whether you were hotter or colder than normal.\n",
            "That can alter you to an oncoming illness or menstrual cycle or pregnancy, which would be useful, but it can also be impacted by significant changes to the ambient temperature or your bedding, which may make it somewhat less useful.\n",
            "So what do we actually do with all of this data?\n",
            "For me, that's always the missing part of the equation.\n",
            "I now have a ton of numbers in front of me, which I may or may not fully understand.\n",
            "But even if I do understand them, I'm not really getting any info on what actions I can take to improve things.\n",
            "How do I integrate this stuff into my daily life to actually be healthier?\n",
            "That's where Fitbit's new Stress Management Score, which combines your heart responsiveness (via heart rate, heart rate variability, and EDA scans), the impact of your physical activity, and how well you've been sleeping comes in.\n",
            "It includes a breakdown of what each item means and how you might be able to improve it using other features within the app (e.g., meditation, yoga, or exercise routines).\n",
            "Fitbit says it will be making the scores and reports that are in the premium-only Health Metrics Dashboard available to all Fitbit owners in the “coming months.”\n",
            "While this isn't the be-all and end-all, this is actually the closest I've seen any fitness tracker come to bringing everything together, both from a pure data perspective and a “what you can do about it” perspective.\n",
            "Fitbit's Premium plan not only offers you a clearer picture of your overall health in the exclusive Health Metrics Dashboard, but it includes hundreds of meditations and video workouts you can try.\n",
            "Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.\n",
            "It's impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\n",
            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate.\n",
            "The Bazecor software and the firmware for the Dygma Raise are both open-source and don't require you to agree to a EULA before you use it.\n",
            "All of the files associated with Bazecor and the firmware can be found on the Dygma GitHub page.\n",
            "While Dygma doesn't recommend that you alter the firmware, instructions for doing so can be found here.\n",
            "For those willing to pay more, Fitbit is launching a new personal coaching service that pairs you with a certified health professional.\n",
            "With this, you will be able to text with your coach every day (Monday through Friday).\n",
            "They will have access to all of your Fitbit data and work with you to come up with training and / or nutrition plans to help you meet your goals.\n",
            "Unfortunately, because of my tight review window, I haven't been able to go too deep into this.\n",
            "But in the one day that I've been working with my coach, she has asked me a lot of good questions, and she seemed to understand my goals, metrics, and constraints.\n",
            "I'm cautiously optimistic about it.\n",
            "Confusingly, Fitbit also makes a Fitbit Coach app, which has nothing to do with the above mentioned personal coach.\n",
            "It's a part of Premium, and it's really just a repository of workout videos.\n",
            "But here's the weird thing: it doesn't actually integrate with your Fitbit.\n",
            "It tells you what the estimated calories are for a given workout before you do it, and then it just adds that number to the part of the app that logs your data.\n",
            "Why it doesn't pull data from its own fitness tracker that you are presumably wearing to not only give you a better assessment, but also provide better recommendations for workouts that are right for you, is somewhat baffling.\n",
            "As with Fitbit's Versa, the Sense isn't just a fitness tracker; it's also a smartwatch.\n",
            "I was testing it with my Google Pixel 3 XL, and Fitbit was able to key into the messaging APIs, so not only could I view incoming messages, but I could respond with quick texts and even voice-to-text.\n",
            "(These features are sadly not available if you pair the Sense with an iPhone.)\n",
            "I also liked that it was easy to control which apps on my phone can and can't send notifications to my Fitbit.\n",
            "The Sense has NFC, so I was able to use it for mobile payments via Fitbit Pay, and it worked without issue.\n",
            "I can use it to control music on Spotify, but if you want to actually store music on your watch so you can leave your phone at home, you're limited to premium services from Pandora and Deezer.\n",
            "I don't think I know a single person who subscribes to Pandora or Deezer.\n",
            "There is a decent number of apps not just from Fitbit but from various third parties (as well as a gajillion watchfaces), which vary in quality.\n",
            "The Sense's UI is newly redesigned, and I found it surprisingly intuitive to navigate, though some of the lagginess detracted from what would otherwise feel like a premium smartwatch experience.\n",
            "There are also some features that are coming within the next few months that weren't yet available for me to test.\n",
            "One is the ECG app, which is expected to arrive in October.\n",
            "You'll open the ECG app on the Sense, put your thumb and forefinger on opposite corners of the device, and it will scan for signs of atrial fibrillation (A-fib).\n",
            "While the Sense already has Alexa built in, sometime soon, you'll have the option to change that to Google Assistant, which I generally find to be much more useful on a device like this.\n",
            "Also, the Sense has a built-in speaker, so soon, you'll be able to actually hear the audible replies from Alexa or Google Assistant, and you'll be able to make phone calls from the watch itself, as long as your phone is nearby.\n",
            "Overall, the Sense is a nice smartwatch, and it does indeed feel like it comes closer than anything I've used at getting the most complete picture of your day-to-day health.\n",
            "It also presents a bit of a conundrum for someone like me.\n",
            "I gravitate toward more rough-and-tumble activities, and Fitbit can't touch Garmin's pedigree (or battery life) in that arena.\n",
            "But when I'm not off on adventures, do I want a more holistic view of my health, especially as I start to age and soften in places I don't want to soften?\n",
            "Yeah, I do.\n",
            "Ultimately, I think this watch has a lot of potential, but I'd give it a couple of months to see if Fitbit can work out the kinks.\n",
            "Update, 2:40PM ET, September 22nd, 2020: Fitbit reached out to clarify that the Stress Management Score is available for free to all Sense owners, but those that subscribe to the Premium plan will receive more insights on what the score means and how it is calculated.\n",

            "Another Galaxy Watch 5 rumor is that in lieu of the Classic, Samsung will introduce a Pro model.\n",
            "All we know so far is that the Pro will have a significantly larger battery to make up for the poor battery life on the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup.\n",
            "SamMobile's report also states this Pro model could potentially only come in one size.\n",
            "And, given the recent trend in wearables, that probably means a significantly bigger size.\n",
            "Should Samsung keep the physical rotating bezel to the larger Pro, you end up creating less choice for consumers.\n",
            "People with smaller wrists who want a medium-sized watch that retains the physical rotating bezel are left with no good solution.\n",
            "People with larger wrists who want a sleeker vibe and good battery life are also left wanting.\n",
            "I'm sympathetic to the fact that shifting over to Wear OS comes with its own challenges that likely require creative thinking both in terms of technology and design.\n",
            "Figuring out the right mix of SKUs to cater to a diverse customer base is also a huge challenge.\n",
            "It's a problem that Samsung isn't facing alone.\n",
            "Its competitors also have yet to figure out how to reconcile mass production with the fact that humans come in all shapes, sizes, and design preferences.\n",
            "I just know that removing or limiting options for consumers isn't the answer.\n",
            "Samsung had a good thing going with the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup by providing four sizes across two distinct styles.\n",

            "Several years ago, I had to deal with a situation that may be familiar to a lot of people: I was slammed with a series of high medical bills that had been denied by the insurance company.\n",
            "The doctor was in network, but according to the insurance company, his bills were coded wrong.\n",
            "Or wait, his facilities weren't in network or… well, you get the idea.\n",
            "It took over a year and many phone calls to iron out the issue — and I wouldn't have gotten through it had I not been able to record each phone call I made with the insurance company and the various medical facilities involved.\n",
            "Today, it would be nearly impossible.\n",
            "Federal law in the US says that you can legally record a phone conversation, but only if you are taking part in that conversation.\n",
            "State laws differ.\n",
            "While most states generally follow the federal guidelines, some require all parties to consent to the recording, rather than just one.\n",
            "You know how, when you're calling a business, you get a recording that tells you that your call may be recorded?\n",
            "That's why.\n",
            "And, of course, there are reasons for those restrictions.\n",
            "An individual's right to privacy can be severely impacted if their phone calls are recorded without their knowledge, which is why warrants are usually needed for a law enforcement authority to tap a suspect's phone and why those statements that your call may be recorded (mentioned above) are necessary.\n",
            "Wary of legal ramifications, and completely ignoring the needs of their customers, both Apple and Google have made it nearly impossible to record any calls made by their phones in the US.\n",
            "Google is about to put the nail in its phone-recording coffin by clamping down on its Accessibility API, the last method third-party app developers had for getting around its restrictions.\n",
            "Without that, Android users in the US may have only one way of recording calls (short of rooting their phones): use Google Voice to record incoming calls.\n",
            "However, Voice does not let you record outgoing calls — even though it announces the call is being recorded when it is switched on.\n",
            "Options for iPhone users seem to be equally limited.\n",
            "There are still apps that will, according to their description, record your phone calls.\n",
            "These generally use three-way calling in which the third party is the recording service provided by the developer.\n",
            "I haven't personally tried any of these, but, from what I could tell, most of them tend to be costly and quirky — and you'd better trust the company that's doing the recording.\n",
            "Which means that, unless I am in a place where I can (a) use my phone on speaker and (b) set up a separate recorder, I have no way of recording an outgoing phone call.\n",
            "Instead, I need to go back to the old-fashioned method of grabbing the nearest piece of paper and scribbling notes as fast as I can, hoping that I get everything right.\n",
            "And I have no way of offering a recording or a transcript of a call to an insurance company or other business, no way of making sure I have a record of my doctor's instructions, and no way of recording my elderly relative's unexpected remembrance of an old family story.\n",
            "This is incredibly frustrating.\n",
            "Why should businesses be able to casually record any conversation that occurs while I cannot?\n",
            "I'm perfectly happy to have an app announce to all parties that a conversation is being recorded — as long as I can then get that conversation on the record.\n",
            "I can only be grateful that, for a short time, I, as an individual, was able to use a simple technology to track my important phone conversations so that I could prove that I didn't owe several thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n",
            "Perhaps in this time of security cameras, drones, and other, more invasive possible privacy violations, Google and Apple will one day rethink their policies.\n",

            "Don't expect to get frequent updates toward the end of its lifespan  but getting any kind of update five years after launch is fantastic for a midrange Android device  \n",
            "Samsung has addressed some of our software complaints  too  \n",
            "The A53 5G ships with Android 12 based One UI 4 1  which is a little tidier than the version that came before it  \n",
            "It is still a Samsung device  though  and Samsung still desperately wants you to live in its world with its own app store  virtual assistant  and constellation of pre downloaded apps  \n",
            "If you're happy living in Samsung's world  or at least don't mind putting up with it  then the Galaxy A53 5G should reward you with an excellent return on your investment  \n",
            "The Galaxy A53 5G is the first Samsung phone sold in the US to use an Exynos chipset since 2015  \n",
            "Samsung has continued using its own brand chips in international versions of its phones  and they've shown up in recent wearables   \n",

            "It's paired with 6GB of RAM  which is more than you'll find on most other midrange phones  \n",
            "Performance seems to be about on par with the A52 5G  \n",
            "Using them side by side  sometimes there's a slightly longer lag after tapping on the search bar before the keyboard pops up on the A53  \n",

            "I notice slight hesitations here and there throughout my daily use  but all within the normal range for a midrange phone and nothing I couldn't live with  \n",

            "I'd expect overall performance to hold up reasonably well  even after three or four years of software updates  too  \n",
            "Whether you buy the phone unlocked or through a carrier in the US  you'll have one choice of storage options  128GB  \n",
            "That's a healthy amount for this price range  and if you run out of space after a few years  there's a microSD slot for additional storage  \n",
            "The A53 5G features a 6 5 inch OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate  and it offers a good level of detail with 1080p resolution  \n",

            "The A53 5G features IP67 dust and water resistance  which is still rare in this class  \n",
            "That means the A53 5G should stand up to splashes  spills  and some water submersion  \n",
            "If you've ever seen a phone die a watery death after an accidental drop in a body of water  let's not talk about what happened at West Seattle Summer Fest 2019   then you know how valuable that water resistance is  \n",
            "The other key spec improvement is the upgrade from a 4 500mAh battery to a 5 000mAh capacity  \n",
            "Samsung claims the new battery will get you through two full days of use  and if you're a light user or on Wi Fi most of the time  then that's a fair claim  \n",
            "I can get through a full day no problem  even streaming some video and spending most of my time on 5G  but not quite two days  \n",
            "I did push it pretty hard on day two by downloading Genshin Impact  but I only got to about 2PM when I started getting prompts to charge the phone  \n",
            "Light users can expect to get through two days on a charge  but if you're a moderate or heavy user  it might be best to recharge overnight to avoid dipping into the single digit percentages  \n",
            "There's no charging brick included in the A53's box  though a USB C cable is included  \n",
            "The headphone jack that the A52 included is gone  too  because all good things must end  \n",

            "This is fine   mmWave is hard to find anyway  \n",
            "If you're buying your phone through Verizon  you are likely paying for it on your monthly bill rather than at the full retail price   in which case the mmWave version is your only choice  \n",

            " You're more likely to get a sharp shot in moderate lighting conditions   \n",
            "There's also a 12 megapixel ultrawide  along with 5 megapixel macro and depth sensors  \n",
            "Expect good quality photos in bright light  with punchy  saturated colors  \n",
            "The main camera holds its own in dim and even very low light  with a night mode that brings out a good amount of detail provided your subject isn't moving much  \n",
            "Portrait mode photos are serviceable  too  especially when there's plenty of light  but not as impressive as we saw on the Galaxy S22  \n",
            "There's also no telephoto lens here  so your only option for portraits is the wider view of the standard camera  \n",

            "There's additional stabilization available in 1080   30p mode  but it's best suited for bright outdoor light  \n",
            " Clips in moderate and low light with this feature enabled look dark and noisy   \n",
            "Altogether  it's a camera system that's good for the price  \n",
            "You'd certainly get better from a flagship   including a telephoto lens   but it does an adequate job  \n",
            "The A53 doesn't quite measure up to the midrange class leader  the Google Pixel 5A  \n",
            "Portraits and low light photos look just a little better from the Pixel  and colors are a little less saturated  \n",
            "But I can find some nits to pick in Samsung's software   mainly that it's Samsung software  \n",

            "To be fair  Samsung has done a little cleanup since One UI 3 0  like removing the ads at the top of the weather app  \n",
            "You can hide all of the superfluous Samsung apps in a folder  and it's possible to use the phone without ever creating a Samsung account if you want to live your life without an extra login  \n",

            "The A32 offers an ultrawide in addition to its standard wide camera and shoots 4K video  so it's a better choice if image quality is a priority  \n",
            "It's almost a year old at this point  but it's still scheduled to get three more years of security updates  \n",
            "It's already getting Android 12  too  so it's a step ahead on the software side  \n",

            "OnePlus says it plans to sell the phone unlocked at a later date  but a company spokesperson  Spenser Blank  wouldn't offer any comment on whether the company will seek 5G certification on Verizon and AT&T when it does  \n",
            "There's also the fact that OnePlus is being a little disingenuous by saying that the N20 5G offers a triple rear camera array  \n",
            "Sure  there are technically three image sensors back there  but only one of them is worth caring about  \n",
            "There are some minor trade offs to be aware of  too  like the fact that the phone doesn't shoot 4K video and has a low grade built in speaker  \n",
            "But overall phone performance is a strength  along with a good OLED screen in a category stacked with mediocre LCD panels  \n",
            "Those are important things to get right  and the N20 does just that  \n",
            "One of the N20 5G's standout specs is its 6 43 inch 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate  \n",
            "More expensive phones offer contrast rich OLEDs and faster refresh rates  but a budget phone can't have both   at least not right now  \n",
            "While other manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola have opted for lower contrast LCDs that offer higher 90Hz refresh rates  OnePlus went the other way with the N20 and skipped the fast refresh rate to offer an OLED  \n",
            "The difference in refresh speeds is really only something you'll notice if you're coming from a phone with a fast refresh rate screen  \n",
            "Animations will look just a little bit choppier compared to the smooth motion of a 90Hz or 120Hz display  \n",

            "Colors look a little punchier  and watching video is more enjoyable  especially when it's something with a lot of dimly lit scenes  looking at you  The Batman   \n",
            "I think this is a trade off a lot of people can appreciate  \n",
            "The screen's 1080p resolution is above average  too  since 720p is more common in the budget class  \n",
            "For a screen this big  you really do need that higher resolution to keep images looking sharp  \n",

            "It's also just not a good speaker  \n",
            "But you can't have everything on a budget phone  and this seems like a reasonable trade off  \n",
            "The N20 includes a healthy 128GB of built in storage  which can be expanded by way of the microSD card slot  \n",
            "There's also a real  live headphone jack on this phone  and it ships with a fast charger in the box  \n",
            "That completes the trifecta of features that are quickly disappearing from flagship and midrange phones but that you can still find in the budget class  \n",
            "The phone supports 33W wired charging with the included charger  but  unsurprisingly  no wireless charging   \n",
            "With the phone powered off and the battery completely depleted  it charged up to 30 percent in a mere 20 minutes  \n",
            "In total  the phone charged from flat to 100 percent in an hour and 15 minutes in my testing   at least 15 minutes faster than the typical budget phone  \n",
            "Most of the time  you can get to a very usable 90 percent much sooner  as charging slows down considerably for the last 10 percent of battery  \n",
            "The N20's 4500mAh battery isn't the biggest in the class  but it does power the phone through a full day of use   even heavy use  \n",
            "With the always on display and high performance mode enabled  a mix of Wi Fi and 5G usage  and some battery hungry activities mixed in  like downloading and playing 20 minutes of Genshin Impact  I've gotten close to 3 5 hours of screen on time in the last 24 hours and I'm down to 20 percent battery  \n",
            "Based on those numbers  it's fair to say that the N20 5G will easily get a light or moderate user through a full day of use  \n",

            "In the meantime  OnePlus' version of Android 11  and 12 for that matter  is a little more minimalist and a little less whimsical than the Samsung or Google versions  \n",

            "OnePlus says that Android 12 will be the only OS platform upgrade for the N20  which is a bummer with the next OS version right around the corner  and that it's scheduled to receive three years of security updates  \n",
            "Three years of support isn't the worst policy among Android device makers  but it's not the best   that honor would go to Samsung  with four or five years of support depending on the phone  \n",

            "The n77 C band frequency  which Verizon and AT&T rely on a lot  isn't on the spec sheet  for example  \n",
            "So if it does get 5G certification on those carriers  it may only be for the slower might as well be LTE variety  \n",
            "But for now  the story is simple  the N20 5G supports T Mobile 5G  \n",
            "While Verizon and AT&T are hurrying to build out their mid band 5G networks  read  the good 5G  T Mobile got a big head start years ago when it bought Sprint  \n",

            "All this is to say that the N20 is in great shape to take advantage of a very fast network if you happen to live somewhere with good T Mobile 5G coverage  \n",
            "There are two large camera modules on the back of the N20 5G  which might lead you to think that there are two important cameras on this phone  \n",
            "There are not  \n",
            "The top camera is a 64 megapixel f 1 8 standard wide  and the module below it is a 2 megapixel macro camera   the same kind of small  low grade macro camera found on many other budget phones  \n",
            "Its relatively large housing is just window dressing  \n",
            "The third  smaller lens belongs to a 2 megapixel monochrome sensor  which is the only thing more pointless than a tiny macro camera  \n",
            "The good news is that the 64 megapixel main camera is good  \n",
            "Images taken outdoors in good lighting are pleasant  exposures are balanced  and colors look a little warmer than on Google's Pixel phones but less saturated than on Samsung's Galaxy devices  \n",
            "It's a nice sweet spot  \n",
            "I'm impressed with the 2x digital zoom on this camera  too  \n",
            "In good lighting  details are surprisingly sharp  \n",
            "It's not a lot of reach  but it's good enough that I'd use it in a pinch when getting closer to my subject isn't possible  \n",
            "Images taken indoors in less good lighting can look a little artificially bright  as is common with other OnePlus phones  \n",
            "Night mode has a habit of taking this a step further  with color saturation that tends to look artificial  \n",
            "But given the choice  I'd take just about any night mode over no night mode at all  \n",
            "The macro camera is about the same as any other smartphone macro camera  very low res and not very useful  \n",
            "To even enable it  you need to tap  more  in the camera app and pick it out of a grid of options where it's dead last in the third row after  text scanner   Maybe OnePlus is hoping you won't find it  \n",
            "I wish this camera were an ultrawide instead  \n",
            "As for the monochrome sensor  OnePlus quietly phased it out of its flagship phones  but it's still hanging around here in the budget class  \n",
            "Supposedly  it supplies additional image information when you're shooting in the black and white filter mode  \n",
            "Covering the sensor with my finger produces an image that looks exactly the same as with it uncovered  \n",
            "Counting this sensor as the phone's third rear camera is definitely a stretch  \n",
            "Video  as mentioned above  is limited to a maximum resolution of 1080p  \n",
            "That's too bad since 4K has really become the standard for high resolution video  \n",
            "As it is  the 1080p clips are good  if a little noisy in low light  \n",
            "There's an aggressive crop  but as a trade off you get some fairly good electronic image stabilization  \n",
            "Swapping out the macro and monochrome sensors with even a mediocre ultrawide would have been a worthwhile exchange in my book  at least an ultrawide is tangibly useful  \n",

            "One thing to be aware of is that the screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution  so the image is noticeably more pixel y than what you'd see on a higher resolution screen  such as the 3546 x 2160 OLED on the Dell XPS 15  \n",

            "At 3 11 pounds  this laptop is a breeze to carry around  \n",
            "It's basically the same weight as last year's model  which looks otherwise very similar to this year's  though the Book2 comes in a new Burgundy color   \n",

            "I have trouble thinking of many 15 inch convertibles lighter than this   there are certainly lighter clamshells  like the 2 44 pound LG Gram 15  but it's hard to find them with OLED at this price  \n",

            "While this computer should have broad appeal  Samsung fans will get a bit more out of it than everyone else  \n",
            "You can charge it with Samsung's 65W Universal Charger  which can also charge Galaxy phones and tablets  \n",

            "If I were to buy a Galaxy Book  I would probably also consider buying a Galaxy Tab because the ability to easily whip out a second screen in an airport or coffee shop seems very handy  especially if you only need to bring one charger   and the fact that it's all first party is a good sign for consistent integration down the line  \n",
            "I was also able to easily share photos between the Galaxy Book and the Tab S8 using Quick Share  Samsung's AirDrop competitor  \n",
            "This was a bit slower than AirDrop between a Mac and an iPhone  but it did still work  \n",

            "Probably the one downside of the Book2 360 is the port selection  \n",
            "There are just three USB C ports  one of which is Thunderbolt 4   a microSD  and a headphone jack  \n",
            "This will be fine for some people  but I'd like to see an HDMI or a USB A on there  \n",

            "If I were to buy a Galaxy Book  I would probably also consider buying a Galaxy Tab because the ability to easily whip out a second screen in an airport or coffee shop seems very handy  especially if you only need to bring one charger   and the fact that it's all first party is a good sign for consistent integration down the line  \n",
            "I was also able to easily share photos between the Galaxy Book and the Tab S8 using Quick Share  Samsung's AirDrop competitor  \n",
            "This was a bit slower than AirDrop between a Mac and an iPhone  but it did still work  \n",

            "The only real spec difference is that Apple says the Studio Display now has a  typical brightness  of 600 nits vs  500 on the iMac  but in my actual typical use next to a 2015 vintage 27 inch iMac  that's pretty hard to see  \n",
            "Compared to Apple's other displays across the Mac  iPhone  and iPad lineup  the Studio Display is actually most notable for the things it doesn't have  \n",
            "Let's start with the backlight  \n",
            "In general  the best modern displays create true blacks by cutting all the light coming from the black parts of the screen  \n",
            "There are several ways to do this  and Apple itself uses different tech across its high end products to produce true blacks in various ways  OLED screens on the iPhones  advanced local dimming on the Pro Display XDR  and Mini LED display backlights on the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro  \n",
            "The Studio Display has  well  it has none of that  \n",
            "It's a regular old LED backlight that lights the entire screen all the time  and the darkest black it can produce is basically gray  \n",
            "In normal use in a well lit room  it looks fine enough   LCD displays have looked like this for a long time now   but if you're watching a movie in a dark room  the letterboxing will look light gray  \n",
            "The Studio Display is also notable for being an SDR display  with no HDR modes to speak of  \n",
            "Apple's high end iPhones  iPads  and Mac laptops all support HDR  but the Studio Display tops out at 600 nits  and Apple doesn't offer an HDR mode in the software at all  \n",
            "Again  this comes back to the ancient backlight tech  true HDR requires local dimming  and the Studio Display doesn't have it  \n",
            "The Studio Display also only offers a 60Hz refresh rate  which is both bog standard and also woefully behind Apple's other top tier products like the iPhone 13 Pro  iPad Pro  and MacBook Pro  all of which offer the ProMotion variable refresh rate system that can run as high as 120Hz for smooth scrolling and gaming and as low as 24Hz for movies  \n",
            " The iPhone 13 Pro can even drop to as low as 10Hz to save battery life   \n",
            "There are a lot of less expensive displays with variable refresh rate and HDR tech out there  and they're supported by macOS out of the box  \n",
            "Really the only reason to chase after this display for the screen itself is if you desperately care about having a 5K display that can display MacOS at pixel perfect resolution with no scaling  \n",
            "There's an entire A13 Bionic chip powering the audio and camera system here  same as the iPhone 11  and the camera itself is a 12 megapixel sensor with an f 2 4 lens that's theoretically comparable to the front camera on an iPhone or iPad  \n",
            "There are three mics and six speakers  four woofers and two tweeters  which Apple says can support spatial audio  \n",

            "Really  really great  \n",
            "You can adjust the three mic array to do voice isolation or not in Control Center  and you'll sound as good or better on calls as any conference mics I've ever heard  \n",
            "The only reason you might need something better is if you're regularly recording podcasts or streaming to an audience  \n",
            "The speakers are loud and deep  and while I am not entirely convinced that spatial audio in music is anything but a gimmick and even less convinced that anything like  spatial  audio can be produced by a stereo speaker system located in front of you  Apple is certainly processing its heart out here   if you play an Atmos clip  you'll hear some dramatic swooshing about  which is always fun  \n",
            "These are the best built in speakers I've ever heard  \n",

            "Apple has a long history of producing amazing images with 12 megapixel sensors and A series chips  and for some reason  this thing just looks awful  \n",
            "Actually  it looks awful in good light and downright miserable in low light  \n",
            "I've tried it connected to the Mac Studio and on my MacBook Pro running macOS 12 3  and on both machines  it produces a grainy  noisy image with virtually no detail  \n",

            "I have sent Apple countless screenshots in various lighting conditions and a full sysdiagnose of our Mac Studio and Studio Display review units  and at publish time  all Apple spokesperson Jennie Orphanopoulos could tell me was that Apple's team had  looked into the images you shared  and discovered an issue where the system is not behaving as expected  \n",
            "We'll be making improvements in a software update   \n",
            "There's no timeline on that update  nor any details on what it might improve  \n",
            "Our rule has always been to review products based on what we have in front of us and never against the promise of a future software update  and based on what I have in front of me  I simply wouldn't want to use this camera  \n",
            "The cameras on the new MacBook Pro and M1 iMac are far superior to what we're seeing here  and an iPhone front camera is even better still  \n",
            "It's one of those things that you probably already know if you need it because it's decidedly for professional users with demanding color applications  \n",
            "The Studio Display comes with a nice braided Thunderbolt 4 cable in the box  that same cable can deliver 96W of power to a laptop  enough to charge my 16 inch MacBook Pro  \n",
            "That cable connects to the Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear of the display  there are three USB C ports next to it for peripherals  \n",
            "Ports  \n",
            "People like ‘em  \n",
            "It's rare that an Apple product is such a miss  but the Studio Display in its current state is a confounding miss  \n",
            "If the webcam actually delivered on the promise of iPhone  or iPad quality video  it would at least prompt a reasonable debate about whether having local dimming or HDR or variable refresh rate was worth it  but as it stands  you're getting a less than state of the art display and a bad webcam  \n",
            "If you are adamant about having a 5K display connected to your Mac  it might still be the best option  \n",

            "But then again  a normal GoPro isn't well suited for the acrobatics of an FPV drone  \n",
            "So when GoPro sent us a review unit of its new stripped down Hero10 Black designed for drone pilots  we recruited FPV drone pilot Reza Kurniawan to see if it's up to snuff   and you can see his flying skills on full display in our video review above  \n",
            "Kurniawan is the kind of drone enthusiast who inspired the Bones to begin with  \n",
            "He's been de casing Hero10 GoPros to decrease their weight from 154 grams all the way down to about 33 grams  \n",
            "The demand for so called  naked GoPros  has been high enough that it has become a service he provides to his customers  and the new Bones is a 54 gram version that GoPro sells itself  \n",
            "The internals of this camera are the same you'd find on the Hero10 Black  \n",
            "It has the same GP2 processor  HyperSmooth 4 0 in body stabilization  and image sensor capable of filming 5 3K footage up to 60fps and 4K footage up to 120fps  \n",

            "They offer superb  warm  detailed sound quality and top tier active noise cancellation  \n",
            "And their impressive battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on  enough to outlast all of Sony's top competition  \n",
            "The WF 1000XM4s have a premium  matte black  or light gray  design with stylish rose gold accents  \n",
            "Most earbuds come with standard silicone ear tips  but Sony includes foam style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal that  together with the noise cancellation  do an impressive job at hushing the outside world  \n",
            "On Android phones  the 1000XM4s support Sony's LDAC codec for higher quality music playback  \n",
            "But even when used on other platforms  they're up there with the very best audio focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 2   with much better noise cancellation  \n",
            "The only thing preventing the 1000XM4 from being the perfect set of wireless earbuds is their lack of multipoint   two simultaneous Bluetooth connections  \n",
            "They're also on the larger side compared to some of the competition  \n",

            "The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback  and the compact case holds three additional charges  \n",
            "Their large physical buttons are easy to use  and the earbuds are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance  \n",
            "The Elite 3s lack the multipoint feature that Jabra has long been known for   that's the main sacrifice you make for the price   but in an improvement from past models  either earbud can be used standalone in mono mode  \n",
            "And they're extremely comfortable to wear for long stretches  \n",
            "You don't get features like active noise cancellation or wireless charging  though Jabra does include a so so transparency mode   but the Elite 3s perform reliably with a strong Bluetooth signal  \n",

            "As a result  these earbuds have a much smaller form factor   and their carrying case is mercifully far more manageable  \n",
            "The way these earbuds magnetically latch into the case also means you don't have to worry about one or both buds failing to charge in the case  which was a common annoyance with the Powerbeats Pro  \n",
            "Unlike the Powerbeats Pro  the Fit Pros include active noise cancellation  \n",

            "Though there's no denying their AirPods resemblance  the OnePlus Buds Pro manage to equal Apple's top tier earbuds in comfort and best them in sound quality  \n",
            "The controls are pretty much an exact copy of the AirPods Pro squeeze gestures  but OnePlus manages to best Apple at durability  these are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance  \n",

            "Of course  there are drawbacks  \n",
            "The touchpad and keyboard are quite small  there's no headphone jack  and only one USB C port   and the 16 10 screen is a bit dim  \n",

            "It should also be noted that the games are tiny  \n",
            "The biggest one I have installed right now is just under 160MB  so it'll likely be a long time before the handheld's 4GB of storage is anywhere near full  \n",

            "In Snak you can jump over your own body  and you earn points by eating apples that float into the level  \n",
            "It's familiar but just different enough to feel fresh  and there are multiple difficulty levels that increase the speed dramatically for an extra challenge  \n",
            "Snak doesn't use the crank at all  but it fits the Playdate's retro aesthetic very well  \n",
            "Saturday Edition is  essentially  a tiny LucasArts adventure game crammed onto the Playdate's miniature screen  \n",
            "You play as a man roped into a strange mystery involving dozens of missing people  and  just like in classic point and click adventure games  you do that by talking to lots of characters and collecting items to solve puzzles  \n",
            "It's all fairly straightforward here   don't expect any of the obscure  frustrating logic puzzles the genre is known for   but I've mostly been surprised by how comfortable it's been to sit back and enjoy a game that's almost entirely reading on such a small screen  \n",

            "Initially  you can move one space forward at a time and only diagonally to knock enemies off the board  just like a pawn  \n",

            "It's a seemingly basic puzzle game where you rotate a dot around the inside of a maze made up of connected spheres  \n",
            "It makes great use of the crank  which you use to control the dot  and it steadily throws in new concepts   like enemy dots and reversed movement   to keep things interesting  \n",
            "Like the best puzzle games  Omaze is a straightforward concept executed extremely well  \n",

            "It's created by a big name   Keita Takahashi is best known for the seminal Katamari Damacy   and it's a game built entirely around the crank  \n",

            "It's really satisfying making a daring hairpin turn while a drone tries to attack you and you narrowly avoid a dangerous cluster of floating space wreckage  \n",
            "It's all the more gratifying because one hit   whether you crash into a star  enemy  or some space junk   means instant death  \n",

            "The difference  though  is that the Odin has active cooling  so it's able to run the processor at its highest speed for longer periods of time  unlike thin smartphones  which don't have fans and need to throttle their performance to stay cool  \n",
            "The Odin's fan is almost inaudible on its normal setting  very quiet in performance mode  and about on par with a Nintendo Switch at its loudest in high performance mode  \n",
            "It's a lot less noticeable than handheld PCs like the Steam Deck and the Aya Neo Next  \n",
            "A chip found in Android phones from three or four years ago may not sound impressive  but it's far more powerful than what you'd get with most other Android handhelds  which often use low powered MediaTek or Rockchip SoCs  \n",
            "Those devices are intended to play games from 2D consoles or  at a stretch  early 3D systems like the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64  \n",
            "The Odin  though  is able to emulate more advanced consoles like the Dreamcast  PSP  and GameCube  \n",
            "Between its bigger 16 9 screen and built in controls  it's a more convenient and console like experience than using a newer Android phone with an external controller  even if you sacrifice a little performance  \n",
            "Emulation is inherently hit and miss  and your results will vary depending on how you tweak settings and which emulators you choose  \n",

            "GameCube versions of games  where they exist  will almost always be a better option if you're looking to play something from that console generation  \n",
            "The Steam Deck is an obvious comparison  and while I don't have one in hand to test side by side  it'll clearly perform much better for emulation than the Odin  \n",
            "Here's a video showing that you can even get good results with PS3 games on the Deck  which can be notoriously challenging  \n",
            "On the other hand  the Steam Deck is much bigger and more expensive than the Odin  not to mention harder to buy   so it might be overkill for emulation if you're mostly interested in older games  \n",
            "The Odin is a really great device for streaming games  as long as you're in Wi Fi range  \n",
            "It has all the controls you need  and its big 16 9 display is the perfect size and sharpness  \n",
            "I played a ton of Xbox Game Pass titles and found the Odin to be a much better experience than any phone  even one with a controller attached  \n",

            " One unfortunate note  while Sony's PS4 and PS5 Remote Play app runs fine on the Odin if you pair a DualShock or DualSense controller  I couldn't get it to work with the built in controls   \n",
            "Native Android games also work well  and you can download anything from the included Google Play Store  \n",
            "The Snapdragon 845 might not be the latest chip  but there aren't many Android games that can't get decent performance on it  \n",
            "Genshin Impact is the usual stress test  and I got a solid 30fps at default settings  \n",
            "Games with controller support automatically treat the Odin as if you have a pad hooked up over Bluetooth  and Ayn's software layer also lets you easily map touchscreen commands to the Odin's physical controls in games like Genshin and Call of Duty Mobile  \n",
            "The one major game I couldn't get to run was Fortnite  which first returned an error message telling me to disable a developer mode I hadn't turned on  then booted me from any match I attempted to enter because of  internet lag  your IP or machine  VPN usage  for cheating  or being on an untrusted platform   None of those issues should have applied  needless to say  except apparently the last one  \n",
            "The Odin's software is essentially stock Android 10   the Lite model has Android 11    with Google services included  as well as an optional launcher  \n",
            "I found this launcher useful for system level features like adjusting fan speed and the LED lights  but it requires you to add all your games manually in order to launch them  which I didn't really find to be worth the effort over just using regular Android for basic operations  \n",
            "Google's OS isn't perfectly optimized for 6 inch landscape displays  but at least it's familiar and works the way you'd expect  \n",
            "While Netflix doesn't show up in the Play Store  other streaming apps like Prime Video do  though you might have to turn the Odin on its side to use the phone style UI before your video starts  \n",
            "If you're really adventurous  you can install the Arm based version of Windows on the Odin through an open source project specifically for the Snapdragon 845  I did not try this and don't think it would be a good idea for most people  but hey  the option is there  \n",
            "As with any handheld gaming device  battery life depends on what you're doing with it  but I found the Odin's to be generally very good  \n",
            "The Pro version has a 6 000mAh battery  which is bigger than any phone that doesn't make a giant battery its main selling point  while the regular Odin and Odin Lite's are a still pretty big 5 000mAh  \n",
            "I didn't do dedicated rundown tests  but I haven't found myself ever needing to rush to a charger in my time with it   it's not like the Steam Deck  where you're lucky to get a couple of hours from newer games  \n",

            "Streaming  traditional Android gaming  and emulation are all relatively niche use cases  of course  when compared to something like a Nintendo Switch Lite  \n",
            "The Odin won't be for everyone  \n",
            "But there's something to be said for putting the flexibility of Android into a well made  capable portable console and letting you do what you want with it  \n",
            "While Ayn doesn't have its own games store to lean on  the Odin's appeal is that it does for Android what the Steam Deck does for PC gaming   it brings the platform to a convenient form factor and says  hey  go check out what this thing can do   \n",

            "The RAW Plus file sizes aren't substantially bigger than the standard RAWs either  which leads me to believe it's not compiling a lot more information into that computational RAW file  \n",

            "It's a stamina champ with up to 20 hours of continuous playback  \n",
            "Speaking of batteries  a unique trick offered by the Charge 5 is its ability to recharge external devices  there's a USB A port for topping up your own phone or a friend's as you listen to tunes  \n",
            "JBL's Charge 5 is a powerful Bluetooth speaker with a marathon battery life of up to 20 hours  \n",

            "But if you do  the XB43 also supports Sony's LDAC codec  and like JBL's Charge 5  there's a USB A jack on the back for juicing up your gadgets  \n",
            "The headphone jack is a goner on most phones these days  and sadly the aux input is also increasingly disappearing from many Bluetooth speakers  \n",
            "But this one gives you the best of everything  \n",

            "With an IP56 dust and water resistance rating  the Move is designed to be weatherproof  and it's able to withstand some bumps  \n",

            "On top of its full sized keyboard that types like a dream  my music and games sound better played through this laptop's speakers than almost any that I've tested before  on par or slightly below where Apple's speakers are in the 16 inch MacBook Pro   \n",
            "Games have a lot more punch in their sound than what I've experienced with other gaming laptops  \n",
            "The display on the Strix Scar 17 is great while the laptop is plugged in  but a little less so while running off of its battery  \n",
            "That's because there's a feature that gradually dims and brightens the panel depending on what is displayed  \n",
            "It's on by default  but it can be turned off within the Intel Graphics Command Center  \n",
            "Another quirk that's hard to ignore is this laptop's lack of a webcam  \n",
            "Despite adding a webcam to this year's ROG Zephyrus G14  G15  and others  Asus still has a handful of gaming laptops without one   the Strix Scar 17 included  \n",
            "The top bezel seems big enough to house a small lens  so Asus' decision to omit a webcam just feels like a miss  \n",
            "Otherwise  I have no complaints about the display  \n",
            "The configuration that I'm testing has a 17 3 inch QHD IPS panel with a 240Hz refresh rate  \n",
            "It supports 100 percent of the DCI P3 color gamut  and its 300 nits of peak brightness make it just bright enough to read when it's basking in natural light from a window  \n",
            "Asus offers a 1080p display option for the Strix Scar 17  but QHD is the right resolution for a 17 inch gaming laptop  \n",
            "4K is still too demanding on even the best mobile hardware  \n",
            "By comparison  QHD isn't as much of a challenge  yet it still looks nearly as good as 4K  not to mention  it looks dramatically better than 1080p   \n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 talks a big game about bringing what gamers want  and its specs mostly deliver on that promise  \n",
            "Cyberpunk 2077  currently one of the most system intensive PC games  can run at almost 50 frames per second with QHD resolution  ultra graphics settings  DLSS on   and ray tracing settings switched on  \n",
            "That result is about 17fps shy of what the 2022 Razer Blade 17's RTX 3080 Ti was capable of  \n",

            "At ultra settings  no DLSS  in QHD resolution  it achieved a smooth 65fps  while turning DLSS on yielded a 7fps boost  \n",
            "With every game that I tried to run  the Strix Scar 17 didn't face many obstacles running them at their best settings  \n",
            "Its specs can handle most games without needing to be amped up to the laptop's  performance  or  turbo  modes  the keyboard has dedicated buttons to do this   which boost the clock speeds of the CPU and graphics card  and then amps up the fan speed accordingly  \n",
            "The laptop's fans can get loud  but it's no louder than most other high end gaming laptops  \n",
            "And even at peak performance  the Strix Scar 17's above average speakers do an admirable job at hushing the sound of the fans  though  dialogue heavy games won't fare as well  so use some headphones if that applies to you   \n",
            "Also  on the topic of cooling  only the rear most components of this laptop become toasty during gameplay  but not so hot that it can't be comfortably used or handled  \n",
            "The Strix Scar 17 delivers commendable performance outside of gaming  primarily in creative focused applications like Adobe Premiere Pro  \n",
            "It ripped through our export test faster than most recent laptops that we've tested  completing its render of our 4 minute  33 second 4K video file in just two minutes and nine seconds  \n",
            "It also fared very well in the PugetBench suite of benchmarking tools for Premiere Pro  scoring 1 001  which beats every laptop we've tested so far in 2022 aside from MSI's pricier GE76 Raider  \n",
            "It's practically a given that any powerful gaming laptop will have not so great battery life  \n",
            "And unfortunately  that's the case here  \n",
            "Its 90Wh battery can last about three and a half hours under normal use  which I define as running a dozen or so browser tabs  music streaming  and a chat app like Slack  \n",
            "On the brighter side  you can recharge this year's Strix Scar 17 via USB C   up to 100W with a USB C PD charger  \n",
            "Previous versions of this laptop all but required you to tote around its large and hefty 280W power brick  \n",
            "So long as you don't plan on gaming on the go  USB C recharging is a viable option  \n",
            "Asus's Strix Scar 17 proves that you don't need to spend a fortune to get access to a fast Intel Alder Lake processor or Nvidia's 3070 Ti mobile graphics card  \n",

            "The new ROG Zephyrus G14 likely can't stack up with its power  \n",
            "But its new ROG Zephyrus M16  for example  has similar specs to the Strix  packed into a sharper design that has a webcam  \n",
            "Additionally  it has a taller 16 10 aspect ratio  though slightly smaller screen  \n",
            "While its GPU's total graphics power is likely less than the Strix Scar 17's  the M16 may be a solid alternative if you know you want a powerful Asus laptop  \n",

            "But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit  agree  to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don't read and definitely can't negotiate  \n",

            "The mandatory policies  for which an agreement is required  are  \n",
            "In addition  there is a slew of optional things to agree to  \n",

            "While there are some great ones out there  it's easy to pay too much  to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn't work with your desired console or platform  or to get one that's uncomfortable after a few hours of use  \n",
            "Knowing a thing or two about headphones might aid in your search  but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for   especially the wireless ones  \n",
            "For instance  wireless headsets made for Xbox operate via Microsoft's proprietary wireless protocol  \n",
            "They'll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in  in most cases  \n",
            "Conversely  if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2 4GHz wireless USB dongle  it'll likely work on the likes of the PS4  PS5  Nintendo Switch  when plugged into the console's TV dock   and PC   but not Xbox  \n",
            "In short  it's best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform s  explicitly  or just buy a wired gaming headset instead   \n",
            "This guide focuses mostly on newer options that you're likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that  while possibly still being worthy of your money  are often tougher to find affordably and easily online  \n",

            "While this headset likely won't satisfy most enthusiasts because of its lack of a boom microphone  it utilizes beamforming microphones  and its minimal noise isolation  that doesn't take away from the G435 being a lightweight and comfortable delight to use  \n",
            "The G435 ships with a USB A audio transmitter and is compatible with most platforms that have that port  including PCs  PlayStation consoles  and the Nintendo Switch's dock  \n",
            "It isn't compatible with Xbox  though  \n",
            "I've also had success using a USB A to USB C adapter to plug it into my Oculus Quest 2  MacBook Pro  and other devices  \n",
            "The G435's killer feature  aside from its broad compatibility and comfort  is its Bluetooth mode  which lets you connect to a phone so you can remain available to accept calls while you use the headset for something else via the 2 4GHz transmitter  \n",
            "You can also just use them as standard headphones via Bluetooth  \n",
            "It's far from the first device to combine Bluetooth with 2 4GHz wireless  but the G435's lightweight design makes it an easier companion to carry around and use for work and play  \n",

            "This isn't a robust headset with steel reinforced arms  like many of our other options below  \n",
            "Yet  when it's on your head  it's comfortable enough that you might just forget about that little detail  \n",
            "The ear cups are mounted to rails that extend from the headband  letting you easily move them around until you find the right fit  \n",
            "And even though one look at its advertising should tell you that these were built for a younger generation  my large head fits comfortably within the range of the G435's sizing  \n",
            "There's no annoying clamping  and these are extremely lightweight  so fatigue wasn't something that I encountered  \n",
            "Sound quality is better than I expected for the price  and I often found myself picking these up just to listen to music  \n",

            "It's actually similar in appearance and comfort to the company's more affordable H3 Hybrid wired headset  which includes Bluetooth support in addition to its wired connection  \n",
            "But the H3Pro Hybrid cuts the cord  the option for wired is still there  though  and adds other capabilities that make it worth the price hike  \n",
            "The latest wireless gaming headset from Epos brings stellar sound quality  lots of comfort  and dual connectivity via 2 4GHz and Bluetooth  \n",
            "Notably  the H3Pro Hybrid features a switch that toggles active noise cancellation and further reduces the amount of incoming noise from your surroundings  \n",
            "The thick  plush ear cups already do a good job at limiting noise as it is  and ANC takes it a step further  \n",
            "It's difficult to hear much of anything around you when the sound dampening feature is on  so gamers who need to focus closely on positional sounds should find these to be a great companion  not to mention how handy the feature is for just filtering out noise to focus on work   \n",
            "Outside of that  the H3Pro Hybrid makes good on its price by nailing the fundamentals  \n",
            "The steel reinforced headband feels strong and flexible  and it offers a staggering amount of sizing options  going far beyond the size that my large head requires  \n",
            "The ear cups clamp down just tightly enough to make a seal with your skin  and there's a generous amount of padding at the headband to keep it from weighing you down  \n",
            "Battery life is good  \n",
            "These support USB C charging  and with ANC on  they can last around 20 hours per charge or more than 30 hours with ANC off  \n",
            "They sound good out of the box  but the Epos gaming suite software for Windows is necessary for tweaking the equalizer and other sound and mic settings  \n",
            "With a little fine tuning  I was able to achieve my preferred sound reproduction of somewhere between warm and a reference sound  with just a little bass to give it some pep  \n",

            "In our review  we found it to be a comfortable  intuitively designed headset that's well worth the price  \n",
            "In addition to working well with Xbox consoles  it can connect to another device simultaneously via Bluetooth  \n",
            "Battery life is fine but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge  \n",
            "While I really like the Bluetooth feature  this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling  say  phone calls or playing   pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected  \n",
            "Another fault is that this model lacks a 3 5mm headphone jack  but that might not be a big deal for you  \n",

            "My greatest moments of disappointment with this monitor were when I was trying to outsmart the interface  which commonly makes it harder than necessary to make simple adjustments  \n",
            "The AW3423DW isn't the only OLED that can deliver amazing picture quality  bright colors  and true blacks  \n",
            "You can still use an OLED TV as a gaming monitor  \n",
            "And  if you're someone who watches a lot of movies and TV shows and enjoys console gaming  getting something like LG's 42 inch C2 might actually be the better buy  \n",
            "That's mainly because it has a 16 9 aspect ratio  allowing modern gaming devices  be it a PC  a Switch  or the Xbox Series X or PS5  to fully fill out the screen  in addition to having HDMI 2 1 and 4K 120Hz support for consoles and PC  \n",
            "Plus  LG claims that its latest OLEDs are brighter than ever  but we haven't been able to test them yet ourselves  \n",
            "On the AW3423DW  Microsoft's Xbox Series X or Sony's PS5 consoles are limited to displaying in 16 9  hello  big black vertical bars on the sides of the picture   \n",
            " You'll first need to turn on Performance Mode within the PS5's game preset settings   \n",

            "At the 60Hz and 100Hz options  High Dynamic Range was available as an option when the Alienware was in its HDR Peak 1000 mode  but the picture wasn't noticeably altered by the setting  \n",
            "Things were different once I connected a newer 2021 MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip   and not necessarily in all good ways  \n",
            "While the AW3423DW could go up to 175Hz with this laptop connected  and it could support variable refresh rate  1Hz 175Hz   enabling HDR was never an option  \n",
            "All said  the results could differ if you use  say  a Thunderbolt 4 dock  or a USB C to DisplayPort for a direct connection to the monitor  \n",
            "But in my testing  I wasn't able to take full advantage of the AW3223DW's features in macOS  \n",
            "The AW3423DW has the slight advantage when it comes to brightness  \n",
            "Standard OLED TVs  like the LG C1 we reviewed last year  can sometimes appear dim because of an Automatic Static Brightness Limiter  a mechanism that's in place to prevent pixels from overheating  \n",
            "In our review  Sean Hollister said the OLED panel got so dim during his non gaming use that it caused eyestrain  \n",
            "Well  after using this QD OLED  I can safely say that this isn't an issue here  \n",
            "But that doesn't mean those auto dimming techniques aren't present  they just aren't as noticeable  \n",
            "This monitor can display a small white window close to or directly on Alienware's claim of 1 000 nits of peak brightness  \n",
            "But expanding it to cover more of the screen will cause it to dim  as is usually the case with OLEDs  \n",
            "This can be seen in both of the AW3423DW's HDR modes  HDR Peak 1000 and DisplayHDR 400 True Black  though True Black generally looks less bright at default settings with less of a dramatic shift in tone as you scale content up and down in size   \n",
            "This dimming effect is especially noticeable if you have two windows side by side in dark mode and switch one over to white  which causes the entire panel to take a noticeable step down in brightness  \n",
            "If you want to get in the weeds  check out the technical analysis from the YouTube channel HDTVtest that shows the AW3423DW dipping to a low of around 280 nits with white taking up the full screen  \n",
            "Compare that to RTINGS's review of the LG C1  which measured 125 nits of peak brightness with a similar test  \n",
            "The QD OLED's gains are minor but a step in the right direction   especially if you're playing games that have a lot of snow or highlights  \n",
            "One other interesting observation from HDTVtest is that you may notice better contrast and darker blacks with the AW3423DW  and perhaps other QD OLEDs if they're built the same way  in a dimly lit room  \n",
            "The monitor's screen coating omits a light reflecting polarizer  and thus  deep blacks can appear gray if you're using it in a well lit room  \n",
            "I didn't notice a huge difference in day to day usage at The Verge's offices  \n",
            "Blacks still looked inky and deep in a well lit room  but viewing the display in the dark makes everything look even better  \n",
            "You may be considering Alienware's QD OLED monitor alongside some other curved monitors  \n",
            "Some of the most popular models are Samsung's 49 inch Odyssey G9 and the newer Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monitors  \n",
            "It'd be a good alternative for people who want way more screen real estate  along with an eye searing 2 000 nits of peak brightness  if not for a few show stopping issues that we encountered during our reviews  \n",
            "If you're a gamer  the 32 9 aspect ratio that Samsung used on both the Odyssey G9 and Odyssey Neo G9 could be an immersion breaker  \n",
            "Even in games that have ultrawide compatibility  we noticed that there was usually stretching around the edges of these monitors  \n",
            "That's less of a knock against Samsung and more on the limited use cases of that ultra ultrawide screen size  \n",
            "Then  there are the bigger issues  \n",
            "In our Neo G9 review  we noticed off colored shadows in games as well as instances where the monitor displays horizontal lines when the colors darken  \n",
            "That may not happen with every unit  but it's not an issue that you'll have with the AW3423DW  \n",
            "OLEDs can be a little more sensitive to extended use versus LEDs  and there are a couple of features built into this monitor to safeguard the panel and extend its lifespan  \n",
            "One is a pixel shifting technique that happens automatically  triggering every few minutes  \n",
            "It shifts all of the screen's pixels in a direction  yet it's hardly noticeable  \n",
            "Then  there's  pixel refresh   a process that takes about seven minutes to complete  \n",
            "The monitor will ask you to perform it if it's been on for four hours straight  \n",
            "If you decline  it'll perform the feature automatically the next time the monitor enters standby mode should your use exceed four hours  \n",
            "Lastly  the  panel refresh  feature can be manually triggered  it will happen automatically after 1 500 hours of use  to completely refresh every pixel in the QD OLED  \n",
            "It supposedly takes an hour to run through that process  \n",
            "Despite being a first generation product  the AW3423DW doesn't feel like one  \n",
            "What's more  it costs less and looks better than many 4K monitors that I've seen  \n",
            "And it lives up to Samsung Display's promises by delivering a brighter picture than we've seen before in OLED TVs  \n",
            "Yet  it may not be the perfect monitor for everyone  \n",
            "Its on screen display and joystick controls are far less intuitive to use than they should be  and it may take some time to tweak the display's settings to suit your non gaming needs  \n",
            "It's also lacking in high end HDMI 2 1 ports for faster refresh rates over HDMI  and its 21 9 aspect ratio means that modern consoles won't fill the whole screen  \n",
            "Admittedly  those are all minor gripes if you know what you're getting into  \n",
            "For being the first  and so far the only  QD OLED monitor on the market  Alienware's AW3423DW should satisfy a lot of people  \n",

            "Alienware has announced the second generation of its flagship Area 51m gaming laptop  the Area 51m R2  \n",
            "It's largely similar on the outside to the original Area 51m  but the specs are almost completely overhauled on the inside  with 10th Gen Intel processors  new Nvidia GPUs  faster RAM  and better display options  \n",
            "All of those upgrades will be limited to the new R2 model  though  \n",
            "Despite Alienware's goals for future proofed upgradable parts  the Area 51m has failed to live up to its potential  \n",
            "One of the biggest draws of the Area 51m was the option for user replaceable parts  \n",
            "Most modern laptops have nearly all of their internal components sealed in place in an effort to cut down on size  \n",
            "But the Area 51m took a different approach  \n",
            "It was big  easy to disassemble  and made it simple to replace nearly every internal component  from RAM to the CPU to the GPU to even the thermal cooling components  \n",
            "The idea was to make something more portable than any other desktop but more customizable than any laptop  \n",
            "Alienware's parent company  Dell  even built its own system for replaceable GPUs in laptops  called DGFF  Dell Graphics Form Factor  to make it easier to upgrade in the future  \n",
            "It's an idea that Dell would later make good on by selling replacement RTX 2070 and 2080 modules for users who had initially bought the less powerful GTX 1660Ti or RTX 2060 cards and decided that they wanted an upgrade  \n",
            "Admittedly  upgrading from one GPU to another within the same family isn't what most people do with gaming PCs  \n",
            "To be fair to Alienware  back when it launched the Area 51m  the company never outright promised that it would offer new GPUs   only that customers would be able to upgrade within the selection of cards already on offer  \n",
            "The company even told The Verge at the time that it'd  like to be able to say yes  to new GPU upgrades   right now  we have no idea   \n",
            "But now  with the launch of the Area 51m R2  there are new GPUs that use the DGFF format  \n",
            "According to Dell  the  Area 51m R1 only supports GPU upgrades within its current generation of graphics cards   In other words  you can upgrade to the already available RTX 2070 and 2080 through upgrade kits but not the new RTX 2070 Super and 2080 Super options that are shipping with the Area 51m R2  \n",
            "You also can't upgrade the processor in the R1 model to the new 10th Gen chips that are being offered on the R2 model  like the GPU  customers can only upgrade within the existing array of 9th Gen chips that the R1 shipped with  despite the fact that the Area 51m uses standard desktop sockets  \n",
            "Not all of this is on Alienware  \n",
            "Intel  for example  changed the socket specifications for its new 10th Gen desktop chips  making them incompatible with older motherboards that work with the 9th Gen lineup   like the Area 51m R1  \n",
            "But it highlights the limitations of taking a desktop style approach to a single laptop  desktop PC owners can easily upgrade their motherboards if they want to take advantage of Intel's latest hardware while retaining most  if not all  of their PC's parts  \n",
            "That's not an option that's available to Area 51m owners  \n",
            "It's hard to look at the Area 51m as anything but a failed experiment  \n",
            "The Area 51m was supposed to offer the best parts of desktop gaming PCs and portable gaming laptops in a single device  \n",
            "Instead  with its hefty price tag and limited upgradability  it's ended up as a series of compromises that emphasize the worst limitations of both categories  \n",
            "If you've been looking at the field of gaming laptops for the past couple of years  you've probably noticed that they are getting thinner  lighter  and less conspicuous  \n",
            "Today's gaming laptops are not only capable of playing the latest games at high frame rates  but they can also pull double duty for productivity work just as easily  \n",
            "It is a behemoth that calls back to the time when all gaming laptops were thick  heavy computers that never left the comfort of a sturdy desk  \n",
            "But while the Area 51m is twice as heavy and almost twice as thick as the latest Razer Blade or thin MSI gaming laptops  it does things that those computers just can't  \n",
            "It's more powerful  thanks to a desktop class processor and full power mobile GPU  instead of the lower power Max Q graphics cards and mobile processors found in those other machines  \n",
            "Unlike most  it has a 17 inch display and a full size keyboard  with both a number pad and macro keys  \n",
            "But it also has the ability to let you upgrade its primary components when better  faster chips become available  \n",
            "That's just not something you can do with the vast majority of gaming laptops on the market right now   whether they're thin or not  \n",
            "The Area 51m is technically not the first laptop to offer this kind of upgradability  \n",
            "There have been big clunkers of laptops in the past that let you upgrade the CPU  and there's still an upgradeable GPU standard called MXM  \n",
            "To avoid having to use MXM  Alienware's parent company Dell developed its own system for workstations called DGFF  Dell Graphics Form Factor  that allows it to put the latest GPUs on modular boards that can then be swapped out  \n",
            "The Area 51m is the first consumer laptop to make use of this new platform  \n",
            "The Area 51m's design may immediately separate from the rest of the gaming laptop pack  but if it's really going to justify its cost  it needs to be a top performer out of the box  \n",
            "Fortunately for Alienware  it is  \n",
            "It's perhaps best to think of the Area 51m as a  portable desktop   as opposed to a laptop or truly mobile computer  \n",
            "It's a massive machine  weighing over 8 5 pounds and measuring 1 7 inches at its thickest point  \n",
            "It has two power adapters  which vary in size depending on the internal configuration  but they add at least another few pounds to the total package  \n",
            "This isn't the kind of computer you can just unplug and carry away from your desk  moving it from place to place is a production each time  \n",
            "It's also not the kind of computer you'll be able to use while traveling  \n",
            "Sure  you can bring it from one place to another  but you won't be gaming along the way because that demands two power outlets  and the giant machine is practically unsafe to use on your lap  \n",
            "Even though the Area 51m is far heavier and larger than most modern laptops  gaming or not   it's a pound lighter than the Alienware 17 it replaces  thanks to its new magnesium alloy chassis  \n",
            "The Area 51m's overall design signals a new direction for Alienware  and it will inform other products the company releases in the future  \n",
            "I like it  the matte white   lunar light  in Alienware's marketing speak  model I've been using for this review is modern  attractive  and smooth to the touch  \n",
            "But it's not subtle  there's no mistaking this for anything but a gaming laptop  with its multiple alien head logos and various lighting effects  \n",
            "The most prominent design feature is the gigantic rear exhaust  with its hexagonally patterned grates for ventilation  surrounded by a single ring of LED light that makes the whole assembly look a bit like the engine of a sci fi spaceship  \n",
            "I don't mind the look  but if you want a sleeper gaming rig  this isn't it  \n",
            "In terms of basic specs and layout  the Area 51m has a full size  non chiclet keyboard with a number pad  a traditional trackpad with physical buttons  it lights up when you touch it   and a 17 inch display with slim bezels on the sides and top  \n",
            "I'm not the biggest fan of the keyboard or the trackpad   both feel like something that would have been appropriate on a computer a decade ago   but if you're coming from an older Alienware laptop  you'll feel right at home  \n",
            "The keyboard has customizable macro keys and full RGB lighting options  and since most people will instantly plug a gaming mouse into the side of the Area 51m  the trackpad's small size and so so tracking performance aren't that much of an issue  \n",
            "My biggest complaint is the annoyingly squeaky N key on my review unit  but I have a feeling that is limited to my sample  \n",
            "Still  it's not something I'd want to put up with on a multi thousand dollar computer  \n",
            "Alienware offers four different display options with the Area 51m  but they all share the same size and resolution  17 inches and 1080p  \n",
            "The display on my higher end review unit is a 144Hz panel with Nvidia's G Sync tech plus built in Tobii eye tracking  and it's great for gaming  \n",
            "It's fast  there's little to no ghosting  and its anti glare finish helps cut down reflections  \n",
            "It's not the brightest screen  especially compared to something like a MacBook Pro  but it's about average for gaming laptops  and it's not like you'll be using this thing outside anyway  \n",
            "I do wish there were higher resolution options since the Area 51m's hardware is definitely capable of pushing more pixels  but Alienware tells me that there just aren't 17 inch  high resolution  high refresh panels with slim bezels available yet  \n",
            "When those components are available  it will make them an option at the time of purchase on the Area 51m  it says  \n",
            " The display is not something you'll be able to upgrade after the fact   \n",
            "The Area 51m has the standard set of ports you'd expect on a gaming laptop in 2019  three USB A 3 1 ports  a Thunderbolt 3 Type C port  HDMI  Mini DisplayPort  2 5 gigabit Ethernet  a headset jack  a microphone jack  and Alienware's proprietary graphics amplifier port for an external GPU  \n",
            "That's probably enough ports for the average gamer  but I'd have liked to have seen even more  including an SD card slot  \n",
            "There's a lot of empty space on the Area 51m's chassis that could be used for more I O  and multiple Thunderbolt 3 ports or an SD card slot would have made the computer much more attractive to the content creators that would use its horsepower for video editing and other tasks  \n",
            "Inside the hulking chassis is a Z390 chipset  with a desktop processor  up to 64GB  four sticks  of RAM  two M 2 SSD slots  a 2 5 inch drive bay  and Dell's DGFF modular graphics card  \n",
            "You can get the Area 51m with a Core i7 8700 processor and Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU to start  but I think most people interested in this machine will opt for the higher end  and more expensive  configurations  \n",
            "The model I've been testing has the Core i9 9900K processor  RTX 2080 GPU  32GB of DD4 2400MHz RAM  two 512GB M 2 SSDs  in a RAID 0 setup for a total of 1TB of fast storage   and an additional 1TB hybrid drive for more storage  \n",
            "It is possible to buy the lower end configurations and then upgrade down the road   after all  this is a desktop processor and modular graphics card   but that really only makes sense for upgrading to new generations of CPUs and GPUs  not ones from the same generation  \n",
            "The battery inside the Area 51m is a large  90 watt hour unit  but that doesn't translate into great battery life  \n",
            "In my tests  I was able to get about 90 minutes to two hours of use between charges for productivity work and closer to 30 minutes while gaming  \n",
            "That means you'll want to carry around both of the Area 51m's power adapters when you bring the computer places  as you'll need both of them for full power gaming  \n",
            "It is possible to rely on just the smaller  180W charger for productivity work  but if you're already lugging the Area 51m around  you might as well fully commit  \n",
            "All of those specs and power mean little if the components can't stay cool enough to run optimally  which is the biggest challenge with gaming laptops  \n",
            "Fortunately  the cooling system Alienware developed for the Area 51m is excellent  and it's able to keep both the CPU and GPU at temps well below their throttling points  \n",
            "It's not silent   the fan system is very loud  especially when at full speed   but it's effective  and it lets the Area 51m hit performance numbers that are much closer to what a desktop provides than a laptop  \n",
            "Loud fans are not really unusual for a gaming laptop  and if you're in the market for the Area 51m  you probably expect it  \n",
            "There are powerful speakers up front that can overpower the fan noise  but most people will just want to use a headset while gaming so they don't have to hear the fans at all  \n",
            "You just might not be able to get away with using the Area 51m in a quiet office or library without getting some dirty looks  \n",
            "Playing games is what the Area 51m was designed to do  and it does that job excellently  \n",
            "It is able to play virtually any modern AAA game I throw at it with the graphical settings maxed out and still maintain high frame rates  \n",
            "Even games like Battlefield V and Shadow of the Tomb Raider  which have a lot of eye candy and special ray tracing lighting effects  could be played with virtually every setting turned on and maxed out and the Area 51m still maintains frame rates between 60 and 80 frames per second  \n",
            "That's not quite the full 144Hz that this screen can push  but it's still high enough for a great experience in those games  \n",
            "Competitive shooting games  like Apex Legends  Overwatch  CS GO  and everyone's favorite  Fortnite  can be played with all of their graphical features enabled at 120 to 144 frames per second  \n",
            "Players that prefer high frame rates over eye candy can configure these games with lower settings and run them at hundreds of frames per second  which is well more than the native refresh rate of the display  \n",
            "If stock settings aren't providing enough power  Alienware's Command Center offers overclocking options for both the CPU and GPU to squeeze even more performance out of them  \n",
            "All of that performance headroom highlights the Area 51m's bottleneck  the display's resolution  \n",
            "I have no doubt that the Area 51m could easily push a 1440p panel or maybe even a 4K display in lots of games  but for the time being  you're limited to 1080p  \n",
            "If you're after the fastest frame rates you can get  you probably prefer a high refresh rate screen  but if you are more into visual presentation and eye candy  more resolution is appreciated  especially for non gaming applications  \n",
            "For now  if you want to game or work at a higher resolution on the Area 51m  you'll just have to use an external display  \n",
            "As it stands  the Area 51m is the most powerful gaming laptop you can buy  and its upgradeable features mean it could remain powerful for years to come  \n",
            "When we opened up the Area 51m ourselves  we found that   while it isn't exactly easy   swapping out the CPU and GPU isn't much different than doing so on an average desktop gaming PC  \n",
            "But there's an asterisk next to all of this  we don't know for sure that the next generation of Intel processors or Nvidia or AMD GPUs will actually fit in this computer or how much those modular graphics cards will cost  \n",
            "Dell has said that if it's possible to physically and electrically fit the chips onto its swappable graphics boards  it will offer upgrade options  but Dell admits it doesn't necessarily know what Nvidia's next plans are  \n",
            "That uncertainty makes it tough to swallow the Area 51m's price because we really don't know if this experiment will last  \n",
            "For the cost of a well configured Area 51m  you could buy a desktop computer and monitor with similar power and still have enough money left over to buy a more mainstream thin and light gaming laptop for when you want to game on the go  \n",
            "The Area 51m is an unrealistic option for most gamers  \n",
            "The kind of gamer who is going to demand this level of performance in a portable machine and put up with all of the compromises and costs necessary to get it is likely a competitive e sports player or a virtual reality game developer who needs an easier way to transport their desktop to the next trade show  \n",
            "That said  what Alienware has done with the Area 51m is really impressive  \n",
            "Not only does it hit performance marks unmatched by other portable machines  but it doesn't have any glaring issues or show stopping usability problems that bring it down  other than the obvious compromises with its size and weight  \n",
            "Even just being able to cool these desktop components efficiently enough for them to perform this well in a portable machine is a genuine feat  \n",
            "If you are the type of gamer who wants the ultimate power in a portable machine and are willing to pay any cost to get it  the Area 51m is for you  \n",
            "For the rest of us  I'm hopeful that Dell's plans for upgradability pan out because I'm very curious to see where the Area 51m's ideas on performance and portability go in the future  \n",

            " We told our engineers  ‘‘Go build us a monster  and see what you can do ' And they came back with the Area 51m   Alienware co founder Frank Azor tells The Verge  \n",
            "The Area 51m is simultaneously an answer to two problems  the first  that trend I mentioned about manufacturers leaning toward less powerful  more portable gaming rigs like the Razer Blade or Asus Zephyrus S  It's not that those laptops are bad   for some  they strike a much needed balance between work and play as computers that can handle the newest games  but also offer the kind of battery life  design  and performance needed in a daily driver for school or work  \n",
            " We've been following the trend since 2013   \n",
            "The other is the fundamental problem with nearly all gaming laptops  unlike their desktop counterparts  no matter how advanced your machine  there's essentially a ticking clock attached that counts down to obsolescence  starting the moment you buy it  \n",
            "Without the ability to upgrade critical parts like the CPU and graphics card  there will come a day when you won't be able to run the latest games  \n",
            "The Area 51m looks to solve both of these issues by borrowing heavily from the desktop PC market's playbook  \n",
            "In fact  it essentially is a desktop PC  right down to support for the same desktop Intel Core processors  only with a battery  screen  and keyboard built in  \n",
            "More importantly  unlike nearly every other gaming laptop out there  the Area 51m is designed to let you swap not only the hard drive  RAM and battery  but the CPU and GPU  too  \n",
            "It's not just lip service  Alienware is serious about letting users take this thing apart just like they would a full fledged desktop  down to easily removable screws and labeled guides imprinted into the frame of the laptop to help you through disassembly or reassembly  including specs for each screw should you lose track of one along the way   \n",
            "There are pull tabs to help you remove the laptop's delicate cables by hand  without damaging them  and it shows you the exact order you need to turn the screws for the massive CPU   GPU cooler to properly torque it down  \n",
            "Let's be clear   it's not a job you can do without turning a lot of screws and some thermal paste  \n",
            "But it doesn't feel any harder than building a desktop computer  \n",
            "In many ways  Azor views the Area 51m as a way to get back to the company's roots  \n",
            "Technically   Area 51m  was the name of the company's very first laptop  roughly 17 years ago  \n",
            " We thought to ourselves  if we were Alienware  in  2001    what would we do now   \n",
            "He says the goal wasn't to build something super light or portable or mainstream or with great battery life  more on that in a sec   \n",
            "Instead  the Area 51m is a testament to the kind of product Alienware could create if there were no price constraints or practical limits  one that harnesses the company's extensive experience in the PC gaming space to build the absolute best laptop possible for the fans that have brought them this far  \n",
            " This is absolutely not a mass market machine   says Azor  \n",
            "For those hardcore gamers  there's plenty of firepower  \n",
            "Alienware is offering the Area 51m with Intel's 9th Gen i7 8700  i7 9700K  or i9 9900K   the fastest gaming CPUs you can buy   along with up to a GeForce RTX 2080  the beefiest GPU for laptops yet  \n",
            "Though Nvidia's newly announced mobile GeForce RTX graphics chips aren't quite as potent as the desktop versions  Azor says the Area 51m uses a full fat version that's overclockable  too  with framerates within roughly 5 to 10 percent of a desktop graphics card  \n",
            "And if that's not enough horsepower a year from now  we come back to the intriguing idea of swapping those parts out  \n",
            "Due to the customizable nature of the Area 51m  you can technically slot in any Intel chip that's compatible with Intel's Z390 chipset  and the graphics card is theoretically user upgradable as well  \n",
            "There's a catch  though  \n",
            "Alienware is using its proprietary Dell Graphics Form Factor  DGFF  cards for GPUs in the Area 51m  and since neither Nvidia nor AMD has promised that they'll make future chips compatible with that format  Alienware can't promise future upgrades either  \n",
            "The company thinks it's likely that future GPUs will be small enough and draw little enough power to fit on a DGFF board  but it can't say for sure  \n",
            "Azor says he'd like to bring the DGFF format to future Alienware and Dell G series gaming laptops  which would  in turn  create a larger market for the graphics boards  but he may not be able to justify that either   If customers don't show demand for it  it'll be a novelty and then it'll fade away   he admits  \n",
            "But the interest could also come from other PC makers   Azor says he's willing to sit down and talk with Dell's competitors about the possibility of letting them use DGFF cards  too  \n",
